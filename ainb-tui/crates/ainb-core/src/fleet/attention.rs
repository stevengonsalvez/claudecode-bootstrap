// ABOUTME: The one attention vocabulary the sessions screen paints and answers.

// The TUI used to carry five competing "an agent needs you" surfaces, each with
// its own words for the same four states. This module is the single vocabulary
// they collapse onto: ASK, APPROVE, ERR, DONE — the same four-code collapse the
// hangar Inbox uses, so the two surfaces cannot drift apart.
//
// PURE. No IO, no clock, no daemon. The clock arrives as `now_ms` and the rows
// arrive already read, which is what lets the precedence rule, the header count
// and the age format be unit-tested without a store or a socket.
