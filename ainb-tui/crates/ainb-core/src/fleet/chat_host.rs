// ABOUTME: The host side of the chat surface — one conversation, driven off the
// UI thread, with its effects and their outcomes in one place.
//
// `ainb-plugin-hangar`'s `fleet_chat` owns the state machine, the reducer and
// the renderer. It owns no IO: it emits a `ChatIntent` and waits to be told what
// happened. This is the thing that tells it.
//
// It exists as its own module rather than inside a screen because TWO surfaces
// drive the same conversation — the sessions screen's `thread` and `copilot`
// tabs — and a second copy of "spawn a worker, page the daemon, fold the answer
// back" is how two chat surfaces drift apart in what they render and which
// failures they report.
