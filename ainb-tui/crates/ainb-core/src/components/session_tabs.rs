// ABOUTME: The sessions screen's right-pane tab strip — the switchboard that
// turns one preview pane into the whole attention surface.
//
// Six tabs over one rect: `preview` (the tmux mirror that was always there),
// `ask` (answer what is blocking), `err` (what failed, and why), `thread` (this
// session's chat), `copilot` (the ainb assistant) and `log` (this session's
// notification history).
//
// The strip is the reason `Enter` stops being ambiguous. `Enter` used to mean
// "attach" everywhere, which is the wrong verb on five of these six panes, so
// it becomes scoped to the ACTIVE TAB and each tab declares its own verb here.
// Attach digits are deliberately NOT scoped: `1`-`9` attach from every tab,
// because "jump to that session" is the one action that means the same thing
// wherever the operator is looking.
