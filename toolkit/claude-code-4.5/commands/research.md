# Research

You are tasked with conducting comprehensive research across multiple sources - codebase, web, and documentation - by spawning parallel sub-agents and synthesizing their findings.

## Initial Setup

When this command is invoked, respond with:
```
I'm ready to conduct comprehensive research. Please provide your research question or area of interest.

I can research:
- Codebase: Find implementations, patterns, and architecture
- Documentation: Discover existing docs and decisions
- Web: External resources, best practices, and solutions (if requested)

What would you like me to investigate?
```

Then wait for the user's research query.

## Research Process

### Step 1: Read Mentioned Files First

**CRITICAL**: If the user mentions specific files, read them FULLY first:
- Use the Read tool WITHOUT limit/offset parameters
- Read these files yourself in the main context before spawning any sub-tasks
- This ensures you have full context before decomposing the research

### Step 2: Analyze and Decompose

- Break down the query into composable research areas
- Think deeply about underlying patterns, connections, and architectural implications
- Identify specific components, patterns, or concepts to investigate
- Create a research plan using TodoWrite to track all subtasks
- Consider which directories, files, or architectural patterns are relevant

### Step 3: Spawn Parallel Research Tasks

Create multiple Task agents to research different aspects concurrently. Think deeply about the query to determine which types of research are needed.

**Research Types to Consider:**

**A. Codebase Research (always do this):**
```
Task: "Find all files related to [topic]"
- Search for relevant source files, configs, tests
- Identify main implementation files
- Find usage examples and patterns
- Return specific file:line references

Task: "Analyze how [system/feature] works"
- Understand current implementation
- Trace data flow and dependencies
- Identify conventions and patterns
- Return detailed explanations with code references

Task: "Find similar implementations of [pattern]"
- Look for existing examples to model after
- Identify reusable components
- Find test patterns to follow
```

**B. Documentation Research (if relevant):**
```
Task: "Find existing documentation about [topic]"
- Search README files, docs directories
- Look for architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Find API documentation
- Check inline code comments for important notes

Task: "Extract insights from documentation"
- Synthesize key decisions and rationale
- Identify constraints and requirements
- Find historical context
```

**C. Web Research (if explicitly requested or needed):**
```
Task: "Research best practices for [technology/pattern]"
- MUST use WebSearch tool explicitly (not internal knowledge)
- Find official documentation
- Discover community solutions
- Identify common pitfalls and solutions
- MUST return specific URLs with findings
- Save all search results to /tmp/web-research-results-[timestamp].txt
- Include GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket URLs found in results or citations

Task: "Find external resources about [topic]"
- MUST use WebSearch tool explicitly
- Look for tutorials, guides, examples
- Find relevant Stack Overflow discussions
- Discover blog posts or articles
- MUST include links for reference
- Save results to file: /tmp/web-research-results-[timestamp].txt
- Note any repository URLs mentioned in sources
```

**CRITICAL for Web Research Tasks**:
- Always use the WebSearch tool (DO NOT rely on internal knowledge)
- Save complete search results to `/tmp/web-research-results-$(date +%s).txt`
- Save agent response with URLs to `/tmp/agent-outputs-$(date +%s)-$$.txt`
- Include ALL URLs found (especially GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Include repository URLs from citations and references
- Return the file path with search results for URL detection

**D. Test and Quality Research:**
```
Task: "Analyze test coverage for [component]"
- Find existing tests
- Identify testing patterns
- Check for missing test cases
- Return test file locations
```

**Spawning Strategy:**
- Run 3-6 focused tasks in parallel for efficiency
- Each task should have a clear, specific goal
- Provide enough context for agents to be effective
- Request concrete outputs (file paths, code snippets, URLs)

### Step 3.5: External Repository Discovery Follow-up

⚠️ **CRITICAL: YOU MUST EXECUTE THE BASH SCRIPT BELOW** ⚠️

**AUTOMATIC DETECTION** (runs if web research was performed):

After web research completes, **EXECUTE this bash script** to scan ALL web research results for external repository URLs:

```bash
# Detect repository URLs from all web research results
REPO_URLS=""
find /tmp -name "web-research-results-*.txt" -mmin -60 2>/dev/null | while IFS= read -r file; do
    URLS=$(bash ~/.claude/utils/detect-repo-urls.sh "$file")
    if [ -n "$URLS" ]; then
        REPO_URLS+="${URLS}"$'\n'
    fi
done

# Also scan agent outputs for any repository URLs they mentioned
# (agents may include GitHub URLs in their responses even without WebSearch)
# Scan all recent agent output files (timestamped to avoid session collisions)
find /tmp -name "agent-outputs-*-$$.txt" -mmin -60 2>/dev/null | while IFS= read -r file; do
    AGENT_URLS=$(bash ~/.claude/utils/detect-repo-urls.sh "$file" 2>/dev/null || echo "")
    if [ -n "$AGENT_URLS" ]; then
        REPO_URLS+="${AGENT_URLS}"$'\n'
    fi
done

# Deduplicate and display
REPO_URLS=$(echo "$REPO_URLS" | sort -u | grep -v '^$')

if [ -n "$REPO_URLS" ]; then
    echo "📦 Detected external repositories from web research:"
    echo "$REPO_URLS"

    # Save to file for Step 3.6 with unique identifier (timestamp + PID)
    DETECTED_REPOS_FILE="/tmp/detected-repos-$(date +%s)-$$.txt"
    echo "$REPO_URLS" > "$DETECTED_REPOS_FILE"
    echo "  Saved to: $DETECTED_REPOS_FILE"
fi
```

**Detection Sources**:
1. **WebSearch results** saved by Step 3C agents (primary source)
2. **Agent output citations** - URLs mentioned in agent responses
3. **Search result references** - Links in documentation/articles found

**Supported Platforms:**
- GitHub: `https://github.com/owner/repo`
- GitLab: `https://gitlab.com/owner/repo`
- Bitbucket: `https://bitbucket.org/owner/repo`

**What Happens Next:**
- Repository URLs are collected for analysis in Step 3.6
- Shallow clones (`--depth 1`) are prepared for efficient analysis
- Global cache checked at `~/.claude/research-cache/`
- Parallel analysis will be triggered automatically

**Note**: This step is informational only. The actual cloning and analysis happens in Step 3.6 (below Step 4).

### Step 4: Wait and Synthesize

- **IMPORTANT**: Wait for ALL sub-agent tasks to complete
- **SAVE AGENT OUTPUTS**: Save all agent responses to `/tmp/agent-outputs-$(date +%s)-$$.txt` for repository URL detection in Step 3.5
- Compile all sub-agent results
- Prioritize live codebase findings as primary source of truth
- Connect findings across different components
- Include specific file paths and line numbers for reference
- Highlight patterns, connections, and architectural decisions
- Answer the user's specific questions with concrete evidence

### Step 3.6: Parallel External Repository Analysis

⚠️ **CRITICAL: YOU MUST EXECUTE THE BASH SCRIPT BELOW IF REPOS WERE DETECTED** ⚠️

**AUTOMATIC EXECUTION** (runs if repositories detected in Step 3.5):

When external repositories are discovered, **EXECUTE this bash script** to analyze them in parallel:

```bash
# Check if repositories were detected in Step 3.5
# DETECTED_REPOS_FILE is set by Step 3.5, or find most recent if not set
if [ -z "$DETECTED_REPOS_FILE" ]; then
    DETECTED_REPOS_FILE=$(find /tmp -name "detected-repos-*-$$.txt" 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -1)
fi

if [ -z "$DETECTED_REPOS_FILE" ] || [ ! -f "$DETECTED_REPOS_FILE" ]; then
    echo "ℹ No external repositories detected, skipping repository analysis"
    # Skip to Step 4
else
    echo "📦 Found detected repositories file: $DETECTED_REPOS_FILE"
    echo "🔬 Starting parallel repository analysis..."

fi
```

**Performance Targets:**
- Clone all repos: 2-5 minutes (parallel)
- Analyze each repo: 25-35 minutes (parallel)
- Total: ~30-40 minutes for all repos combined

**Cache Strategy:**
- Save analysis to: `$CLAUDE_HOME/research-cache/<repo>-<commit>/analysis.md` (default: `~/.claude/research-cache/`)
- Check cache before cloning (7-day TTL)
- Reuse cached analysis if query similar (query hash matching)

**Output:**
Each analyzer agent produces:
- Focused analysis markdown in cache directory
- GitHub permalinks to relevant code
- Actionable recommendations
- Pattern extraction

**Integration:**
External repository findings will be integrated into the main research document in Step 5 under the "External Repository Analysis" section.

Save to: `research/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_topic.md`

### Step 6: Add GitHub Permalinks (if applicable)

- Check if on main branch: `git branch --show-current` and `git status`
- If on main/master or pushed, generate GitHub permalinks:
  - Get repo info: `gh repo view --json owner,name`
  - Create permalinks: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{commit}/{file}#L{line}`
- Replace local file references with permalinks in the document

### Step 7: Present Findings

- Present a concise summary of findings to the user
- Include key file references for easy navigation
- Ask if they have follow-up questions or need clarification

### Step 8: Handle Follow-up Questions

- If the user has follow-up questions, append to the same research document
- Add a new section: `## Follow-up Research [timestamp]`
- Spawn new sub-agents as needed for additional investigation
- Continue updating the document

## Important Notes

- Always use parallel Task agents to maximize efficiency
- Always run fresh codebase research - never rely solely on existing documents
- Focus on finding concrete file paths and line numbers
- Research documents should be self-contained with all necessary context
- Each sub-agent prompt should be specific and focused on read-only operations
- Consider cross-component connections and architectural patterns
- Include temporal context (when the research was conducted)
- Link to GitHub when possible for permanent references
- Keep the main agent focused on synthesis, not deep file reading

## Critical Ordering

1. ALWAYS read mentioned files first before spawning sub-tasks
2. ALWAYS wait for all sub-agents to complete before synthesizing
3. ALWAYS gather metadata before writing the document
4. NEVER write the research document with placeholder values

## Sub-task Best Practices

When spawning research sub-tasks:

1. **Spawn multiple tasks in parallel** for efficiency
2. **Each task should be focused** on a specific area
3. **Provide clear instructions** including:
   - What to search for
   - Which directories to focus on
   - What information to extract
   - Expected output format
4. **Request specific file:line references** in responses
5. **Wait for all tasks to complete** before synthesizing
6. **Verify sub-task results** - spawn follow-up tasks if needed
