# Sync Learnings

Bidirectional sync between `~/.claude/` (user-level) and toolkit `packages/` (canonical source).

## Purpose

When working on projects, learnings get captured in user-level agent files via `/reflect`. This command syncs improvements bidirectionally:
- **TO_REPO**: New/updated files in ~/.claude → packages/ (canonical)
- **TO_HOME**: Newer files in packages/ → ~/.claude

## Architecture

```
~/.claude/  ←──sync──→  packages/  ──generates──→  claude-code-4.5/ (thin layer)
                             ↓
                    create-rule.js installs
```

**packages/** is the canonical source. **claude-code-4.5/** only contains tool-specific files (CLAUDE.md, settings.json).

## Workflow

1. **Assess**: Compare directories and categorize differences
2. **Route**: Determine target package directory for each file
3. **Plan**: Generate sync plan table with actions and rationale
4. **Execute**: Copy files in parallel where possible
5. **Commit**: Single commit for TO_REPO changes

## Directory Mappings

### Agents (direct mapping)

| Source (user-level) | Target (packages) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| `~/.claude/agents/engineering/` | `packages/agents/engineering/` |
| `~/.claude/agents/universal/` | `packages/agents/universal/` |
| `~/.claude/agents/orchestrators/` | `packages/agents/orchestrators/` |
| `~/.claude/agents/design/` | `packages/agents/design/` |
| `~/.claude/agents/meta/` | `packages/agents/meta/` |
| `~/.claude/agents/*.md` (root) | `packages/agents/` |

### Commands (routed by type)

Commands are routed based on their purpose:

| Command Pattern | Target |
|-----------------|--------|
| `m-*` (m-plan, m-implement, m-monitor, m-workflow) | `packages/workflows/multi-agent/commands/` |
| `plan`, `implement`, `validate`, `research`, `workflow` | `packages/workflows/single-agent/commands/` |
| All other commands | `packages/utilities/commands/` |

### Other Files

| Source (user-level) | Target (packages) |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| `~/.claude/skills/` | `packages/skills/` |
| `~/.claude/templates/` | `packages/utilities/templates/` |
| `~/.claude/hooks/` | `packages/utilities/hooks/` |
| `~/.claude/output-styles/` | `packages/utilities/output-styles/` |

## Command Routing Logic

```bash
# Determine target directory for a command
route_command() {
  local cmd="$1"
  case "$cmd" in
    m-*)
      echo "packages/workflows/multi-agent/commands/"
      ;;
    plan.md|implement.md|validate.md|research.md|workflow.md)
      echo "packages/workflows/single-agent/commands/"
      ;;
    *)
      echo "packages/utilities/commands/"
      ;;
  esac
}
```

## Exclusion Categories (Never Sync)

### Category 1: Personal Instrumentation
Files with personal/optional integrations:
- `hooks/*.py` with Langfuse, telemetry, or personal API integrations
- Keep separate - don't pollute shared repo with personal tooling

### Category 2: Project-Specific Commands
Commands for specific private projects:
- `commands/data-setup-*.md` - Project-specific data setup
- `commands/load-frameworks.md` - Project-specific framework loading

### Category 3: Session/Ephemeral Data
Runtime state:
- `session/` - Session state files
- `reflections/` - Reflection logs
- `plans/` - Temporary plan files
- `*.json` session files

### Category 4: User Settings
Personal configuration:
- `settings.json`, `settings.local.json`

## Assessment Phase

Before syncing, generate an assessment table:

```markdown
# Sync Assessment: ~/.claude ↔ packages/

## Summary

| Action | Files | Reason |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **SYNC TO REPO** | N files | Useful generic additions |
| **SYNC TO ~/.claude** | N files | Repo has newer versions |
| **DON'T SYNC** | Multiple | Project-specific or session data |

---

## ✅ SYNC TO REPO (from ~/.claude)

### 1. `path/to/file.md` (NEW|UPDATED)
- **Purpose**: [what this file does]
- **Target**: `packages/[routed-path]/`
- **Assessment**: ✅ Valuable addition

---

## ⬇️ SYNC TO ~/.claude (from packages/)

### 1. `packages/path/to/file.md`
- **Status**: Packages version is NEWER
- **What's new**: [description of changes]
- **Assessment**: ✅ Copy to ~/.claude

---

## ❌ DON'T SYNC

### [Category Name]
- `file1.md` - [reason]
```

## Execution

### Shell Alias Workaround

Many shells alias `cp` to `cp -i`. Always use `\cp` to bypass:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Bypasses alias
\cp source dest
```

### Example Sync Operations

```bash
# Agent sync (direct)
\cp ~/.claude/agents/engineering/new-agent.md packages/agents/engineering/

# Command sync (routed)
\cp ~/.claude/commands/m-plan.md packages/workflows/multi-agent/commands/
\cp ~/.claude/commands/plan.md packages/workflows/single-agent/commands/
\cp ~/.claude/commands/session-info.md packages/utilities/commands/

# Skill sync
\cp -R ~/.claude/skills/new-skill/ packages/skills/

# Template sync
\cp ~/.claude/templates/new-template.md packages/utilities/templates/
```

### Commit Format

```
chore: sync learnings to packages

- Add [new-file]: [brief description]
- Update [updated-file]: [what changed]
```

## Quick Diff Commands

```bash
# Find all differences (agents)
diff -rq ~/.claude/agents/ packages/agents/ 2>/dev/null

# Find all differences (commands - check all locations)
for dir in packages/utilities/commands packages/workflows/*/commands; do
  diff -rq ~/.claude/commands/ "$dir" 2>/dev/null | head -5
done

# Find files only in ~/.claude (candidates for TO_REPO)
diff -rq ~/.claude/agents/ packages/agents/ 2>/dev/null | grep "Only in /Users"

# Show actual diff for a specific file
diff ~/.claude/agents/engineering/example.md packages/agents/engineering/example.md
```

## Safety Checks

- **Never overwrite** without assessment first
- **Check modification times** when both versions exist - sync newer to older
- **Skip binaries** and non-text files
- **Validate** markdown frontmatter before copying agent files
- **Route commands** to correct package directory
- **Exclude** files matching exclusion categories

## Example Session

```
User: /sync-learnings

Claude: # Sync Assessment: ~/.claude ↔ packages/

## Summary

| Action | Files | Reason |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **SYNC TO REPO** | 3 files | Useful generic additions |

## ✅ SYNC TO REPO

### 1. `agents/engineering/new-validator.md` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Custom validation agent
- **Target**: `packages/agents/engineering/`
- **Assessment**: ✅ Generic utility

### 2. `commands/custom-workflow.md` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: New workflow command
- **Target**: `packages/utilities/commands/` (routed)
- **Assessment**: ✅ Generic utility

## ⬇️ SYNC TO ~/.claude

### 1. `packages/utilities/commands/sync-learnings.md`
- **Status**: Packages version is NEWER
- **What's new**: Added command routing logic
- **Assessment**: ✅ Copy to ~/.claude

Proceed with sync? [Y/n]

User: Y

Claude: Executing sync...

✅ new-validator.md → packages/agents/engineering/
✅ custom-workflow.md → packages/utilities/commands/
✅ sync-learnings.md → ~/.claude/commands/

Committed: chore: sync learnings to packages
```

## Automation Tip

Add to session start hook for automatic detection:

```bash
# In hooks/session-start
DIFF_COUNT=$(diff -rq ~/.claude/agents/ packages/agents/ 2>/dev/null | grep "differ" | wc -l)
if [ "$DIFF_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️  $DIFF_COUNT agent files differ from packages. Run /sync-learnings to sync."
fi
```
