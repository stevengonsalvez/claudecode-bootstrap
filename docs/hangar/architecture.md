title: "Hangar: architecture & features"
description: "Hangar is ainb's TUI-first managed-agents control plane (a Multica feature replica): daemon + plugin over unix-socket JSON-RPC, with issues, autopilots, skills, a kanban board, and an agent fleet."
---

Hangar gives `ainb` a **managed-agent control plane**: file work as *issues*, assign them to *agents* (Claude / Codex / Gemini), watch tasks march through a lifecycle on a *kanban board*, schedule recurring work with *autopilots*, curate reusable *skills* and *agent templates*, and observe the whole fleet's health: all from the terminal. It is a feature replica of Multica, built natively inside ainb.

It is deliberately **loosely coupled**. A standalone `ainb-hangar-daemon` owns the data plane (SQLite, the task FSM, the cron scheduler, the agent runner). The TUI is a **plugin** (`hangar-tui`) that the host `ainb` binary loads and that talks to the daemon over a unix-socket JSON-RPC contract. The plugin holds *zero* domain logic: it subscribes, pulls snapshots, renders, and forwards key intents. So the control plane keeps running (autopilots fire, tasks dispatch) whether or not a TUI is attached.

## System architecture

Five Rust components in three planes: the **host + plugin** (presentation), the **daemon** (control), and the **store + SQLite** (data). Two cross-cutting crates: `ainb-hangar-core` (IO-free domain types) and `ainb-hangar-proto` (wire types): are shared by everything.

![Hangar layered system architecture](./diagrams/arch-system.svg)

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| **`ainb` (host)** | The ratatui TUI binary (folder `crates/ainb-core`, package `ainb`). Embeds **plugin-runtime v2**, which discovers, spawns, and supervises plugin subprocesses and brokers their host-capability calls. Reach Hangar from the home screen with `g`. |
| **`hangar-tui` (plugin)** | Package `ainb-plugin-hangar`. A native subprocess speaking JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio (Content-Length framing). Renders 9 screens, dials the daemon socket, subscribes to a workspace, pulls snapshots, folds events. No DB, no domain logic. |
| **`ainb-hangar-daemon`** | Standalone binary. Hosts the unix-socket JSON-RPC server, the task **claim loop**, the autopilot **scheduler**, the provider **runner**, the beads sync, and the observability subscriber. |
| **`ainb-hangar-store`** | sqlx repositories + the task-FSM services (claim / start / complete / fail / cancel / retry / sweep). Owns the schema over a single SQLite file at `~/.ainb/hangar/hangar.db`. |
| **`ainb-hangar-core`** | IO-free domain layer: typed ids, the `HangarClock`/`IdGen` traits, the task-status FSM table, the cron parser, env-allowlist policy, skill + autopilot service traits, PR-URL parser, token mint/verify, `TaskResult`. |
| **`ainb-hangar-proto`** | JSON-RPC wire types + method-name constants shared by daemon and plugin. Plus the plugin SDK (`ainb-plugin-protocol` / `ainb-plugin-sdk-rust`). |

The plugin dials `~/.ainb/hangar/hangar.sock` via the host `unix_socket_dial` capability. The daemon resolves a workspace identifier (slug *or* id) to the real row before scoping any query: the guard that closed the cross-tenant IDOR. Plugin subprocesses are spawned with `kill_on_drop(true)` plus an OS leak-guard (`PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` on Linux, `setpgid` + `kill(-pgid)` on macOS).

## Dependency graph

```

`core` is the root and depends on nothing internal, so it stays IO-free and trivially testable. `store` and `proto` both build on `core`; the `daemon` ties all three together. The plugin depends only on `proto` + the SDK: never on the daemon or store crates: so it cannot smuggle in domain logic.

### Key external dependencies

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `tokio` | Async runtime: daemon server, claim loop, scheduler, runner, plugin stdio. |
| `sqlx` (SQLite) | Async, runtime-checked queries; migrations 0001–0010. Postgres-compatible schema for a future backend. |
| `ratatui` + `crossterm` | TUI rendering (host + plugin screens). |
| `cron` v0.12 | Cron parsing (6-field; 5-field POSIX normalised by prepending `0 `). |
| `chrono` | Time math for next-tick calc (bridged to epoch-millis storage). |
| `security-framework` (macOS) | OS keychain backend for the secret store. |
| `sha2` + `subtle` | PAT/daemon-token hashing (sha256, stored hash-only) + constant-time verify. |
| `tracing-subscriber` + `tracing-appender` | Structured JSONL sink with daily rotation (`daemon.<date>`). |
| `opentelemetry` / `opentelemetry-otlp` *(optional `otlp` feature)* | OTLP span export; zero crates linked in the default build. |
| `zeroize` | `SecretBytes` wiped on drop. |

## Data & control flow

Two loops run continuously and independently: the **dispatch loop** (control plane: turns issues into running agent tasks) and the **render loop** (data plane: turns daemon state into TUI pixels).

![Hangar control and data flow](./diagrams/arch-dataflow.svg)

**Dispatch loop (control):**

1. `ainb hangar issue create --assign <agent>` (or an autopilot tick) enqueues an `agent_task_queue` row.
2. The daemon **claim loop** atomically claims the most urgent (then oldest) queued task for an idle runtime (`queued → dispatched`): `ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at, id`: respecting per-agent `max_concurrent_tasks` and the per-(issue, agent) active-set guard.
3. It **materialises skills** into the task's per-task directory at the provider-native path (`.claude/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.agent_context/skills/` …): copied, scripts `chmod 0755`, kept outside the worktree git root so `git status` stays clean.
4. It spawns the provider in an isolated git worktree (`dispatched → running`), streaming the transcript.
5. On a terminal transition the **FSM finalize** path runs idempotently: it stamps `done/failed/cancelled`, cascades `autopilot_run.completed_at` when the task belongs to an autopilot run, and captures any `gh pr create` URL into `result.pr_url`.

**Render loop (data):**

1. The plugin sends `workspace/subscribe` for the active workspace; the daemon registers the (authenticated) connection as a workspace-scoped event subscriber.
2. On the ack it fires snapshot RPCs: `hangar/issues_list`, `tasks_list`, `agents_list`, `skills_list`, `autopilots_list`, `daemon_health`: which the daemon answers from the store (resolving slug→id, scoping by workspace).
3. The plugin folds the wire rows into screen state and renders.
4. The daemon **pushes** `hangar/event` notifications over the same subscription (this closed parity-review design gap 02: the channel used to be decode-only with zero emission sites): the claim loop emits `TaskStarted` and the terminal `TaskFinished` as the FSM finalizes, the Kanban `task_transition` RPC emits the matching lifecycle event when a card actually moves, and the autopilot scheduler / fire-now path emits `AutopilotRunChanged` (fired and skipped ticks). Events are scoped to the subscribed workspace's resolved row id: a tenant never sees another tenant's frames: and only authenticated, subscribed connections receive them. Delivery is best-effort instant feedback; the next snapshot reconciles authoritatively, so a dropped event self-heals.

## Task lifecycle (FSM)

Every unit of agent work is an `agent_task_queue` row walking a strict finite-state machine, exhaustively defined in `ainb-hangar-core` and enforced by the store's finalize services.

![Task FSM state machine](./diagrams/arch-task-fsm.svg)

- **Per-(issue, agent) concurrency**: task work on one issue serialises per **agent**, not globally (decision: adopt Multica's `ClaimAgentTask` model, closing parity-review design gap 03). The partial unique index `idx_one_pending_task_per_issue_agent` (migration 0012, replacing 0004's global-per-issue scope) allows at most one *pending* (`queued`/`dispatched`) task per `(issue_id, agent_id)`, and the claim SQL's `NOT EXISTS` active-set guard refuses to dispatch an agent a second `queued`/`dispatched`/`running` task for an issue it is already working: so different agents work one issue in parallel while the same agent's duplicate fires still coalesce.
- **Priority ordering**: the claim drains `ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at, id` (decision: adopt Multica's `priority DESC, created_at` claim ordering, closing the parity-review "no expedite path" design gap). `agent_task_queue.priority` (migration 0013) is an integer **0..3 mapping P3..P0: higher = more urgent**: `0` = P3 (the routine default, so untouched enqueue paths stay strict-FIFO), `3` = P0 (claimed first). Equal priorities keep the FIFO `created_at, id` tiebreak. `ainb hangar issue create --priority N --assign <agent>` stamps it onto the enqueued task; a retry child inherits its parent's priority.
- **Idempotent finalize**: concurrent complete-vs-cancel resolves deterministically (first wins, loser no-ops); a terminal row never re-transitions.
- **Retry**: a failure with a *retryable* reason (e.g. runtime offline) spawns a child task linked by `parent_task_id`, capped by `max_attempts`; `agent_error` does not retry.
- **TTL sweepers**: stale `queued` (2h) / `dispatched` (5min) / `running` (2.5h) rows are swept to `failed` in idempotent batches (cap 500).
- **Autopilot cascade**: finalising a task carrying an `autopilot_run_id` stamps the run's `completed_at` in the same path.

## Data model

A single SQLite database, workspace-tenant from migration 0001. Every row is scoped to a `workspace`; every by-id query carries the workspace guard (the IDOR fix). The schema is kept Postgres-compatible for a future server backend.

![Hangar SQLite schema ER diagram](./diagrams/arch-schema-er.svg)

| Group | Tables |
|-------|--------|
| **Tenancy** | `workspace` (slug unique), `user` (email unique), `member` (role) |
| **Actors** | `agent_runtime` (status), `agent` (runtime, visibility, owner) |
| **Work** | `issue` + `comment`; `agent_task_queue` (status, `priority` 0..3 = P3..P0, attempt, `parent_task_id`, `result` JSON, `autopilot_run_id`) with a partial unique index = one pending task per (issue, agent) |
| **Skills** | `skill` (unique per workspace/name), `skill_file`, `agent_skill` (M:N junction) |
| **Auth** | `pat` + `daemon_token` (sha256 only), `beads_mapping` (hangar↔bd) |
| **Autopilots** | `autopilot` (cron_expr, max_concurrent_runs, next_tick_at, enabled), `autopilot_run` (status, completed_at) |

## Plugin host capabilities & security

The plugin runs as a separate process and can only reach the host through declared, gated capabilities in its `manifest.toml`. Each capability is a `Bool` or an allow-`List`; the runtime enforces the grant before any privileged action.

![Plugin host capability and security model](./diagrams/arch-capabilities.svg)

| Capability | Host call | Enforcement |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `event_stream_subscribe` | subscribe to event topics | topic-prefix allow-list |
| `spawn_managed_subprocess` | spawn a tracked child (e.g. the daemon) | list-form mandatory; bool-true rejected `-32003`; reaped on teardown |
| `unix_socket_dial` | dial the daemon socket | path allow-list, canonicalised; bool-true rejected `-32003` |
| `secrets:read` | `host/secret_store_get` → OS keychain | key allow-list; `{scope, key}`; read-only (no write path) |
| `workspace:write` | set active / default workspace | bool-only; list-form rejected `-32003` |

:::note
An ungranted capability returns `-32001 CAPABILITY_DENIED`; an ambiguous/unsupported grant form returns `-32003 MANIFEST_VALIDATION`. Separately, every daemon-side by-id query is workspace-scoped (the `resolve_workspace_id` guard) so a leaked id from one workspace cannot read or mutate another's data.
:::

## Autopilots & the cron scheduler

An autopilot is a cron expression + an agent + instructions. A single daemon task drives all of them.

![Autopilot cron scheduler loop](./diagrams/arch-autopilot-scheduler.svg)

- The loop sleeps until the earliest `next_tick_at` across enabled autopilots, via a `tokio::select!` over *sleep*, *shutdown*, and a *wake* signal (used by tests' clock-advance).
- At fire time it re-checks concurrency: if `count(autopilot_run WHERE completed_at IS NULL) >= max_concurrent_runs` it **skips** and emits `autopilot.tick_skipped`; otherwise `fire_autopilot_tick` inserts the run + enqueues the task in one transaction.
- It recomputes the next tick anchored on *now* (not the stale tick) to avoid replay storms; no enabled autopilots → 60s re-poll.

## What it looks like

Three flows, captured from the real TUI. Each is reproducible from the script
named beside it.

### The board

Cards move through queued, running and done. Moving a card fires a real task
transition, so the board is the control surface, not a view of one.

### The control center

Where an agent's question reaches you. The list shows who is waiting; the pane
shows what they asked and the options you can answer with.

A squad fans one job out across several agents instead of running them one at a
time.

## Feature catalogue: what a user does

Every Hangar feature is reachable two ways: a **TUI screen** (open Hangar with `g`, then a hotkey) and/or the `ainb hangar <noun>` **CLI**.

### TUI screens & hotkeys

| Hotkey | Screen | What you do |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `1` | Issues | Browse/filter issues (All/Members/Agents/Mine chips), `c` create, `a` assign agent, `Enter` open task detail. |
| `2` | Task detail | Live transcript (5-colour stream), PR badge + `o` open-in-browser, `r` retry / `x` cancel. |
| `K` | Kanban | 4 columns (queued/running/done/failed); `Shift+←/→` moves a card → fires a task transition. |
| `4` | Skills | `s` sync from toolkit, `i`/`d` attach/detach to selected agent, `Enter` view body. |
| `,` | Settings | Provider keys (keychain write), workspace switching (`s` active / `d` default / `n` new / `r` rename). |
| `5` | Autopilots | List + recent runs; `a`/`e` create/edit, `r` run-now, `d` enable/disable. |
| `D` | Daemon health | Runtimes, claim-cache, concurrent tasks, dual-dim throughput sparkline (green success / red failure). |
| `L` | Logs | Tail the daemon's structured JSONL, level-filter chips, colour-by-level. |
| *(modal)* | Agent picker | Pick a human or agent to assign (presence dots, `/` filter, recents pinned). |

### CLI

```text
ainb hangar issue      create | list | show
ainb hangar task       list | cancel | retry
ainb hangar autopilot  create | list | disable | enable | run
ainb hangar skills     sync | list

```

## Feature × test coverage

Built test-first: every feature carries an **acceptance test** (unit/integration), and most carry an **e2e tripwire**: a real test that drives `ainb tui` in a `tmux` pane (or the daemon over its real socket) and asserts the rendered/persisted result, per the `tmux-ui-tripwire` discipline.

Legend: **✅** = acceptance + e2e tripwire · **✅ (acc.)** = acceptance only · file references are verifiable in-tree.

### Coverage summary

- **22 features have a full e2e tripwire**: 11 via real `tmux` driving `ainb tui`, 11 via daemon-over-real-socket.
- **12 are acceptance-only** (strong unit/integration; no tmux): task retry, task/templates/token CLIs, skill CRUD, autopilot CRUD, JSONL sink, service spans, logs screen.
- **0 are untested**: every feature has at least an acceptance test.

:::caution[Honest gaps: coverage shape, not regressions]
- The **logs screen** and **autopilots manager screen** have reducer + snapshot + real-socket coverage but no `tmux capture-pane` proof of the rendered screen.
- The `task` / `templates` / `token` CLIs are acceptance-only, versus the `issue` path which has a full tmux roundtrip.
- The keychain roundtrip tripwire is `#[ignore]` by default (needs a real dev-mac keychain prompt); the in-memory + cfg-gated backend tests are the authoritative proof.

## How it was built: phases P0–P9

Per-bead TDD (RED → GREEN → review → scoped gate → close), each phase capped by e2e tripwires.

| Phase | Scope | |
|-------|-------|---|
| P0 | Schema + store | ✅ |
| P1 | Task FSM + dispatch | ✅ |
| P2 | Daemon | ✅ |
| P3 | Plugin host capabilities | ✅ |
| P4 | 5 core screens | ✅ |
| P5 | Auth + workspace + secret store | ✅ |
| P6 | Skills + curated templates | ✅ |
| P7 | Autopilots + cron scheduler | ✅ |
| P8 | Kanban + daemon health + observability | ✅ |
| P9 | gh integration + e2e + release | ◐ in progress |

P0–P8 are complete and verified; P9 (gh integration, PR badge, CI matrix) is in the release-prep stretch.
