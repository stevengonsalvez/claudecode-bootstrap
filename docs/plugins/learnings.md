---

`learnings` is the in-tree **memory browser** plugin: it is the read-only TUI window onto the knowledge base that the [`reflect`](/toolkit/plugins/reflect) plugin captures and indexes. Where `reflect` is the *write* side: it watches your Claude Code sessions, captures corrections as learning notes, and dual-indexes them: `learnings` is the *read* side: a Browse / Search / Graph explorer over that same `~/.learnings` store, with no data plane of its own. Open it in ainb with `m`, or from any agent with the `/recall` / `/memory` slash commands.

*Press `m` in ainb to open the learnings screen. Browse lists every note in the KB with its confidence; `f` cycles the filter chips, `Tab`/`/`/`g` switch panes.*

## What it is a view of

`learnings` is, in the words of its own manifest, *"a read-only browser over the reflect knowledge base."* It never writes learnings and never re-indexes: it reads the artifacts `reflect` (and the `reflect-kb` CLI) produce and renders them three ways. It is the natural companion to the [reflect plugin](/toolkit/plugins/reflect) and the [`reflect` CLI](/knowledge/reflect-cli): reflect's `correct once, never again` loop fills the store; `learnings` lets you actually *see* what's in it.

### The memory file system it reads

The knowledge base is a plain directory tree: the canonical root is `~/.learnings/` (the legacy `~/.claude/global-learnings/` root is still read as a fallback). `learnings` reads three kinds of artifact directly off disk, plus one through a CLI:

| Artifact | Path (default) | What `learnings` does with it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Markdown learning notes** | `~/.learnings/documents/learnings/*.md` | The Browse list + the Detail read-pane. Each note carries YAML front-matter (`title`, `category`, `scope`, `confidence`, `key_insight`, `tags`, `provenance`) and a Markdown body. |
| **Entity sidecars** | `*.entities.yaml` next to each note | The **typed graph**. Each sidecar declares `entities` (name / type / description) and `relationships` (`source`, `target`, `type` ∈ `solves` / `caused_by` / `causes` / `requires` / `relates_to`, `strength`). These typed edges are what the Graph tab draws. |
| **nano-graphrag cache** | `~/.learnings/nano_graphrag_cache/` | `graph_chunk_entity_relation.graphml` (the GraphRAG entity graph) and `kv_store_community_reports.json` (the community clusters): the source for the community-cluster view. |
| **QMD index** | `~/.cache/qmd/index.sqlite`, collection `learnings` | The Search tab. `learnings` shells the [`qmd`](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/agents-in-a-box) binary against this index for fast lexical/semantic recall: it does not parse the sqlite itself. |

> **Compatibility, in one line:** if `reflect` (or `reflect reindex`) built it, `learnings` can view it. The plugin reads the **exact** layout the reflect plugin's `recall.py` / synthesis scripts and the `reflect-kb` CLI write: Markdown notes + `.entities.yaml` sidecars + the nano-graphrag graphml/community cache + the qmd index. Because `reflect:ingest` harvests memory from **every** agent (Claude, Codex, Copilot, Gemini) into that one unified store, `learnings` ends up being a single pane over all of them.

### How it lines up with reflect

```
 reflect plugin (Claude Code)            learnings plugin (ainb TUI)
 ───────────────────────────             ───────────────────────────
 SessionStart / Stop / PreCompact
   capture corrections  ─┐
 /reflect  classify + write │  writes      ┌─ Browse   (notes + filters)
   note.md + entities.yaml  ├─▶ ~/.learnings ─┼─ Search   (qmd recall)
 reflect:ingest harvest     │   (+ qmd +      └─ Graph    (entity graph)
   Claude/Codex/Copilot/… ──┘    graphrag)         ▲ read-only, no re-index
```

Reflect owns capture + indexing (and auto-recall back into the agent's context). `learnings` is the human-facing viewer of the same files: so the two share a store but never a write path. Set up reflect first (`ainb reflect bootstrap`); `learnings` then has something to show.

## The three views

`learnings` is a tabbed shell: `Tab` cycles **Browse → Search → Graph**, and `g` jumps straight to the Graph tab from anywhere.

### Browse: the notes

The Browse tab (above) lists every note by id with its confidence, and a row of filter chips (`scope` / `conf` / `category` / `source` / `project`). `f` activates the chips, `↑↓` move, `⏎` opens the Detail read-pane (title, key insight, the Markdown body, the entity + relationship lists, and provenance), `Backspace` closes it.

### Search: qmd recall

![The Search tab: a live query box that recalls from the qmd index](../assets/screenshots/learnings-search.png)

`/` (from any tab) focuses the Search query box; type a query and `⏎` runs a hybrid lexical/semantic search against the qmd index, listing ranked hits you can open into Detail. This is the same recall surface the reflect hooks use automatically at session start: here you drive it by hand.

### Graph: see how memories connect

The Graph tab is where the typed `entities.yaml` relationships come alive. **`g`** focuses it; it has three renderings.

## What graphs can the plugin render?

Three, each a different lens on the same typed entity graph:

**1 · Entity neighbourhood (text)**: the default. Pick an entity from the list and see its typed outgoing edges as `<entity> --<rel_type>--> <neighbour>` lines, aggregated across every note's `relationships[]`.

![The Graph tab entity-neighbourhood view: typed edges like audit-after-rebase --solves--> stale plan execution](../assets/screenshots/learnings-graph-neighbourhood.png)

**2 · Community clusters**: press **`c`** to toggle to the nano-graphrag community view: one row per detected cluster (`title` + member count + impact rating), read from `kv_store_community_reports.json`. This is the GraphRAG "communities" lens: groups of entities that co-occur across many learnings.

![The Graph tab community-cluster view: nano-graphrag community reports](../assets/screenshots/learnings-community.png)

**3 · Radial ego local-graph (the map)**: press **`v`** to swap the text neighbourhood for a spatial, Obsidian-style local graph drawn on the character grid. The list-selected entity sits at the centre; its typed neighbours fan out on a ring as boxed `[entity]` nodes, joined by ASCII edges with **arrowheads** on directed relationships and **colour-coded type labels** (`solves` green, `caused_by`/`causes` red, `requires` blue, `relates_to` grey with no arrowhead). It is fully **deterministic**: no physics, no random layout: so the same KB always draws the same map.

![Radial map journey: open, graph, v to map, navigate, recentre, hops, back](../assets/screenshots/learnings-map-journey.gif)

*`m` → `g` → `v` opens the radial map; `↓`+`⏎` recentres on a neighbour; `h` widens the hop; `Backspace` returns to the neighbourhood.*

The map is an **ego / local** graph: centre + 1 hop by default (toggle to 2 with `h`), capped at 15 nodes with the remainder folded into a single `[+N more]` node that `e` expands. Recentring (`⏎` or a mouse click on a node) animates the new neighbourhood outward and changes the centre:

| Centred on one entity | After `⏎` recentre on a neighbour |
| --- | --- |
| ![Map centred on audit-after-rebase, ↑ solves edge](../assets/screenshots/learnings-map-centre.png) | ![Map recentred on stale plan execution: green solves + red caused_by, ↓ arrowheads](../assets/screenshots/learnings-map-recentred.png) |

For a hot, highly-connected entity the 15-node cap keeps the ring legible and offers `[+N more]`; `e` expands it to the full set:

![Hub overflow: 15 nodes on the ring plus a +3 more node, then e expands to all 18](../assets/screenshots/learnings-map-overflow.gif)

| Capped: `nodes:15 (+3)` | Expanded with `e`: `nodes:18` |
| --- | --- |
| ![A hub with 15 neighbours on the ring and a +3 more overflow node](../assets/screenshots/learnings-map-overflow-cap.png) | ![The same hub after pressing e: all 18 neighbours shown](../assets/screenshots/learnings-map-expanded.png) |

**Not (yet) rendered:** a full-graph (whole-KB, non-ego) view and force-directed physics are deliberately out of scope for v1: the radial ego layout was chosen precisely because it is cheap and deterministic.

### Graph keymap

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `g` | focus the Graph tab |
| `↑ ↓` / `j` `k` | move the selection (neighbourhood/community lists) |
| `c` | toggle entity neighbourhood ⇄ community clusters |
| `v` | cycle the view: neighbourhood → **radial map** → neighbourhood |
| `↑ ↓ ← →` (in map) | move across rings (↑↓) / orbit within a ring (←→) |
| `⏎` / mouse click (in map) | recentre on the selected / clicked node: animated |
| `h` (in map) | toggle hop depth 1 ↔ 2 |
| `e` (in map) | expand the `[+N more]` overflow node |
| `o` (in map) | open the learnings behind the entity (a picker if more than one → Detail) |
| `Backspace` | exit the map / release graph focus (`Esc` is host-reserved) |

## How it works

`learnings` is **lazy-spawned** (manifest `[lifecycle].spawn = "lazy"`): it stays dormant until you open the screen or type `/recall` / `/memory`. On `plugin/init` the host injects the resolved `[plugins.learnings]` config; the plugin scans `learnings_dir` for `*.md` notes (+ their `.entities.yaml` sidecars), aggregates every note's `relationships[]` into a typed adjacency keyed by entity name, and lazily reads the `graph_cache` community json the first time you reach the Graph tab. The Graph map is a pure pipeline: extract the ego subgraph → deterministic radial layout → render boxes/edges/arrowheads/labels: so it renders the same tokens every run. Search shells `qmd` against the configured index; selecting a hit opens the same Detail pane Browse uses.

## Capabilities

Declared in `manifest.toml` `[capabilities]` (everything not listed defaults to deny):

| Capability | Why it is needed |
| --- | --- |
| `read_paths = ["~/.learnings", "~/.cache/qmd"]` | Path-scoped fs read envelope: the plugin may read the KB notes/sidecars, the nano-graphrag cache, and the qmd index, and nothing else. |
| `spawn_subprocess = ["qmd", "learnings"]` | Semantic search shells `qmd`; graph-expanded search may shell `learnings`. |
| `write_plugin_data` | Persist plugin-local UI state under the plugin data dir. |
| `event_bus` | Exposes the snapshot/event reverse channel for refresh. |

It declares **no** `cli_namespaces`: `learnings` is TUI-only.

## Configuration

User-set values live in `config.toml` `[plugins.learnings]` and are injected at `plugin/init`. All four default to the reflect KB's standard layout, so a default reflect install needs no configuration:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `learnings_dir` | `~/.learnings/documents/learnings` | Where the `*.md` notes + `.entities.yaml` sidecars live (Browse + Graph). |
| `graph_cache` | `~/.learnings/nano_graphrag_cache` | The nano-graphrag graphml + community json (community view). |
| `qmd_index` | `~/.cache/qmd/index.sqlite` | The qmd sqlite index (Search). |
| `qmd_collection` | `learnings` | The qmd collection name. |

Point these at any directory that follows the same reflect-KB layout to browse a different store.

## Using it

- **Screen**: provides the `learnings` screen. Open it with `m` (or `/recall` / `/memory`). `Tab` cycles Browse → Search → Graph; `/` jumps to Search; `g` jumps to the Graph tab.
- **Slash commands**: `/recall` and `/memory` both open the learnings screen from any agent context.
