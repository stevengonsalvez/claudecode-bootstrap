`burndown` is the in-tree **screen-owner** reference plugin: it paints the full Analytics dashboard and owns the `ainb usage` CLI tree. It is also the consumer half of the event-bus **publish/subscribe** pattern: it does not scan any session files itself, it renders the snapshots `session-reader` publishes.

## How it works

![burndown plugin: how it works](../assets/diagrams/burndown.svg)

`burndown` is **eager-spawned** (manifest `[lifecycle].spawn = "eager"`). On `plugin/init` it subscribes to `sessions.usage_data` and `sessions.scan_progress`, then publishes an empty payload on `sessions.refresh_request` to kick `session-reader` into a fresh scan with the subscription already on the wire: closing the race where chunk 0 of an in-flight publish would otherwise be missed.

`session-reader` scans `~/.claude/projects/**` and `~/.codex/sessions/**` and publishes the aggregated usage to the host event bus. The host delivers each publish to `burndown` as a `plugin/handle_event` call on the subscribed topic. Large snapshots arrive **chunked**: chunk 0 carries the bounded aggregates, follow-on chunks extend the `calls` / `sessions` / `shell_commands` tails, and the `is_final` chunk assembles the accumulator into the live `UsageData` (a wire-version mismatch latches a schema-upgrade hint instead). Progress ticks on `sessions.scan_progress` drive the "Scanning sessions… N/M" skeleton until real data lands.

For the **Analytics screen**, the host sends `plugin/render` with a `Viewport`; `burndown` paints a ratatui `Buffer`, converts it to a sparse `WireBuffer` cell stream, and the host blits it each frame. Filtering (`analyze_turns` + per-day/project/model rollups) is memoised in a one-deep cache keyed on `(data_generation, filters+period+provider)` so idle re-renders are O(1). Keystrokes arrive via `plugin/handle_key`: most mutate local UI state (period `1`–`5`/`m`/`q`/`a`, provider `←`/`→`/`p`, panel focus `Tab`, zoom `z`, drill-down `Enter`); `r` re-publishes `sessions.refresh_request` and `F` publishes `sessions.flush_cache_request`.

For the **CLI**, the host routes `ainb usage …` through `plugin/cli_dispatch`. `burndown` strips the host-level `--format` flag, re-parses the rest with clap, and runs the report against its latest in-memory snapshot: capturing the legacy report writer's stdout into the JSON-RPC reply. If no snapshot has arrived yet it returns the "install session-reader" hint and the host CLI shim retries until the deadline.

## Capabilities

Declared in `plugin.toml` `[capabilities]` (everything not listed defaults to deny):

| Capability | Why it is needed |
| --- | --- |
| `read_sessions` | Read access to `~/.agents-in-a-box/sessions/**`. |
| `write_plugin_data` | Persist plugin-local config (model aliases, display currency) under the plugin data dir. |
| `event_bus` | Exposes `host/snapshot/get` + `host/snapshot/publish` + `host/log` on the reverse channel: required to subscribe to `sessions.usage_data` and publish `sessions.refresh_request`. |

It does **not** declare `read_claude_logs`, `read_codex_logs`, `spawn_subprocess`, or `network`: burndown no longer scans logs itself; `session-reader` owns the data plane.

## Using it

- **Screen**: the manifest provides the `analytics` screen. Open it from the host's screen navigation; you get the full analytics dashboard (per-day / per-project / per-model panels, drill-down chips, provider filter). In-screen keys: `1`–`5` / `m` / `q` / `a` (period), `←` `→` / `p` (provider), `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` (panel focus), `z` (zoom), `Enter` (drill-down chip), `X` (exclude chip), `C` (clear chips), `Backspace` (pop chip / exit zoom), `k` (scroll up), `r` (refresh), `F` (flush cache + rescan). `Esc` is host-reserved for navigate-back.
- **CLI namespace**: provides `cli_namespaces = ["usage"]`, dispatched as `ainb usage <subcommand>`:
  - `ainb usage report`: compact burndown report
  - `ainb usage today` / `ainb usage month` / `ainb usage status`
  - `ainb usage models [--by-task]`: per-model rollup or model × activity matrix
  - `ainb usage export`: CSV / JSON export
  - `ainb usage optimize` / `ainb usage compare` / `ainb usage yield`
  - `ainb usage plan …` / `ainb usage currency …` / `ainb usage model-alias …`: config subtrees
  - `ainb usage cache info` / `ainb usage cache clear`
  - The host-level `--format <text|json|csv>` flag is honoured on report subcommands.
- **Slash commands**: provides `/usage` and `/burndown`.
- **Snapshot topics**: provides no published topics (`provides.snapshots = []`). It **subscribes** to `sessions.usage_data` (the data plane) and `sessions.scan_progress` (skeleton ticks), and **publishes** the control topics `sessions.refresh_request` and `sessions.flush_cache_request` to drive `session-reader`.
