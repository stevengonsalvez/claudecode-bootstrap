description: "Integrates the external abtop binary (top-for-agents) as a full-screen ainb screen, CLI, and sidebar entry: real-time monitoring of every AI coding agent on your machine."
---

`abtop` surfaces real-time AI coding-agent monitoring inside ainb by wrapping the external [`abtop`](https://github.com/graykode/abtop) binary. It is a **subprocess-wrapping** plugin in the same pattern as [`witr`](/plugins/witr): pressing `t` in ainb hands the full terminal to abtop's own native TUI, returning to ainb on quit: every abtop key works natively, no translation layer.

*Press `t` from any ainb screen (or select the `abtop` sidebar tile) to open abtop's live agent-monitor full-screen. First launch shows the rate-limit consent dialog.*

## What is abtop?

abtop is a `htop`-style TUI that watches every AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, and others) running on the machine: token usage, rate-limit headroom, cost burn, active sessions, and hook-triggered status updates. It is maintained by [graykode](https://github.com/graykode/abtop) and is never bundled into ainb: it is detected at runtime.

## How it works

The screen is a **host-embedded foreign TTY**, exactly like witr. abtop's value is its own live interactive monitor: there is no machine-readable wire format for the live view. Pressing `t` (or the sidebar tile 📡) queues `AsyncAction::AttachAbtop`: ainb runs `tmux new-session -A -d -s ainb-abtop "abtop --exit-on-jump"`, suspends its own TUI, and attaches full-screen to abtop's native monitor. When the user quits abtop, ainb resumes. The plugin's `render` method is never invoked for the screen; this wiring lives entirely in `ainb-core`.

The **CLI** path is different: `ainb abtop [args]` execs `abtop --once [args]` directly, inheriting the parent terminal's stdio so abtop's `--once` snapshot prints cleanly (it only emits a one-shot snapshot against a real TTY, then exits). Args are forwarded verbatim, so any flag abtop itself accepts works: `ainb abtop --theme <name>`, etc. (The in-tree `ainb-plugin-abtop` crate also exposes the same surface over `plugin/cli_dispatch` for the plugin harness, but the live `ainb abtop` command is wired directly in `ainb-core`.)

**First-launch consent**: abtop ships an optional `--setup` hook that installs a Claude Code `StatusLine` hook to feed live rate-limit data. On the very first open of the screen, ainb displays a one-time dialog so the user can opt in (or skip) before anything writes to `~/.claude`. ainb never writes `~/.claude` without an explicit "Enable" choice.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Declared value | Why it is needed |
|---|---|---|
| `spawn_subprocess` | `["abtop"]` | Exec `abtop --once` (CLI path) and `abtop --exit-on-jump` (the full-screen handoff). Detection is a `PATH` lookup (`which abtop`): present/absent only, no version probe and no exec. The list form is per-binary audit metadata. |

All other capabilities (`read_sessions`, `read_claude_logs`, `read_codex_logs`, `write_plugin_data`, `event_bus`, `network`) are left at their deny default.

## Using it

### Screen (`t` key)

Press `t` from any ainb screen, or select the `abtop` / "top-for-agents" entry in the sidebar (shortcut `t`, icon 📡).

ainb suspends and full-screen-attaches to abtop's native TUI running inside a managed tmux session (`ainb-abtop`). Every abtop key works natively: ainb does not intercept or translate them. Press `q` (or abtop's quit binding) to close abtop and return to ainb.

If abtop is not on `PATH`, the screen renders an install empty-state with the canonical install command for your platform rather than silently failing.

### First-launch consent dialog

![abtop first-launch consent: Enable / Just open abtop / Don't ask again](../assets/screenshots/abtop-consent.gif)

On the very first time the screen is opened, ainb shows a one-time consent dialog:

| Choice | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Enable** | Runs `abtop --setup` to install the Claude Code `StatusLine` hook, then opens the monitor. ainb writes to `~/.claude` only on this path. |
| **Just open abtop** | Opens abtop without running setup. The hook is not installed. Dialog shown again next time. |
| **Don't ask again** | Opens abtop without running setup, and suppresses future prompts. The choice is persisted as a marker file under `~/.agents-in-a-box/`. |

The dialog also stops appearing once the rate-limit hook has been installed (ainb detects `~/.claude/abtop-rate-limits.json`). You can re-run the hook setup at any time by invoking `abtop --setup` directly.

### Live monitor

Once open, you are in abtop's own interactive TUI. All of abtop's modal keys pass through natively. Common navigation (taken directly from abtop):

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` / `↓` | Select an agent row |
| `Enter` | Jump to the selected agent's tmux pane (then exits abtop back to ainb, via `--exit-on-jump`) |
| `x` | Kill the selected session |
| `/` | Filter sessions |
| `v` | View menu (tree, timeline, panel toggles) |
| `c` | Config overlay |
| `?` | Help: abtop's full keybinding list |
| `q` | Quit abtop, return to ainb |

These are abtop's own keys (verified against the v0.4.7 footer bar), not ainb's: press `?` inside abtop, or see [abtop's docs](https://github.com/graykode/abtop), for the complete reference.

### CLI (`ainb abtop`)

`ainb abtop` shells `abtop --once` and exits. Any extra args are appended after `--once` and forwarded verbatim to the binary:

```sh
ainb abtop                     # one-shot status snapshot (runs `abtop --once`)
ainb abtop --theme <name>      # forwarded verbatim → `abtop --once --theme <name>`
```

abtop emits human-readable text only: it has no JSON mode, so there is no `--format json` variant here. Because the command always prepends `--once`, it is for snapshots; the full-screen monitor and the one-time `abtop --setup` hook are reached from the TUI (press `t`), not from `ainb abtop`.

If abtop is not found on `PATH`, the CLI prints an install hint and exits with code 1.

## Installing abtop

abtop is an external binary maintained by [graykode](https://github.com/graykode/abtop). ainb detects it at runtime: install whichever way fits your environment:

**macOS (Homebrew: recommended)**

```sh
brew install graykode/tap/abtop
```

**Linux (installer script)**

```sh
curl -sSL https://github.com/graykode/abtop/releases/latest/download/abtop-installer.sh | sh
```

**Any platform (Cargo)**

```sh
cargo install abtop
```

After installing, confirm it is on `PATH`:

```sh
abtop --version
```

ainb picks up the binary on the next launch; no ainb restart is required within an existing session.

## Source

`crates/ainb-plugin-abtop`: detects the external `abtop` binary, owns the `ainb abtop` CLI via `abtop --once` exec, handles first-launch consent state, and renders the missing/install empty state; the foreign-TTY screen handoff (`t` → `abtop --exit-on-jump`) is wired in `ainb-core`.
