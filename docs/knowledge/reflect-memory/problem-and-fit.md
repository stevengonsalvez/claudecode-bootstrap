## The real problem: context engineering, not a bigger file

Every harness gives you one persistent memory primitive: a **static instructions file you maintain by
hand**: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `copilot-instructions.md`. It is front-loaded into the
context window at the start of every session.

That has a hard ceiling. The context window is finite and **shared with the actual task**. Every line
you front-load "just in case" is bloat the moment this particular session doesn't need it: and it
crowds out the files, diffs, and reasoning the task *does* need.

<pre class="rm-ascii">
   context window  =  [ task: files · diffs · plan · tool output ]  +  [ memory ]
                                                          ▲                    ▲
                            this is the work ─────────────┘                    │
                            front-loaded "just in case": bloat when ──────────┘
                            irrelevant, and you can only fit so much
</pre>

So a bigger instructions file is the wrong axis. The questions that actually matter:

- A correction you made three weeks ago ("don't bump the shared proto without regenerating clients")
 : how does it reach the agent *only* in the session that's about to touch that proto?
- The architecture *reason* behind a non-obvious choice ("the double `recalcTax` call fixes an EU-VAT
  rounding bug"): how is it recalled when someone questions that code, and stays invisible otherwise?
- A hard-won veering ("we migrated off JWT to server-side sessions in June"): how does it override the
  stale fact, instead of sitting in a file nobody re-reads?

The goal isn't to store *more*: it's to store the signal-bearing moments and **query the right one at
the right time**, spending context only when it pays. That is a retrieval problem, not a file-size
problem. It's why a class of "agent memory" products exists.

## The memory-product landscape: and where each one pinches

Several tools attack this. They differ on four axes that decide whether they actually fit a
coding-agent workflow:

1. **Do they store everything, or selectively?** Whole-session / fire-hose capture is useful but
   accretes noise and unbounded data over time.
2. **Do they need a separate LLM/embedding key?** Your coding agent already has a model+subscription.
   Most memory tools make you configure and *pay for a second provider* just for memory.
3. **What infrastructure do they run?** A always-on server (Postgres, Redis, a Rust/Bun daemon, a
   vector DB) is operational weight: and often cloud-dependent.
4. **Do they capture coding signals as first-class events?** Corrections, test outcomes, git events,
   skill upgrades: captured *structurally*, or only as prose an LLM might (or might not) extract?

➡️ Full scored matrix, token economics, LOCOMO benchmark and the build-vs-adopt critique:
[Why build, not adopt](/knowledge/reflect-memory/comparison).

¹ Hindsight's `retain` needs an LLM; its "reuse your Claude subscription" loopback is documented as
**personal-use-only per Anthropic's terms**: not shippable. See the
[adopt-vs-build critique](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory#why-build-not-adopt).

The pattern: the tools that *don't* need a second key (claude-mem) tend to **store everything and grow
noisy**; the tools that *do* curate well (Hindsight, Mem0, OpenViking) make you **stand up a server and
pay a second provider**; and **none** of them capture corrections, test outcomes, git events, or skill
upgrades as typed signals: they hope an LLM extracts them from the transcript.

## Where reflect fits

reflect is the row that holds all four columns at once. Its design line: **the brain is client-side,
the store is dumb, and the signals are typed.**

<pre class="rm-ascii">
   harness hooks ──▶ reflect (capture)  ──▶ markdown KB (source of truth)
        ▲              ▲ typed signals              │
        │              │ (corrections, tests,  index (QMD + nano-graphrag)
   harness LLM  ◀── reflect (recall) ◀──── git, skills, contradictions)
   (capture reuses the agent's OWN model: no extra key, no separate sub)
</pre>

| reflect's answer | to the problem |
|---|---|
| **Selective capture**: only signal-bearing moments become learnings; TTL, dedup and contradiction-handling built in | whole-session noise + unbounded growth |
| **Reuses the agent's own model** (`claude -p`) + a local embedding model | no second API key, no separate subscription, no ToS loophole |
| **Local files** (QMD sqlite + nano-graphrag graphml): optional shared Postgres only if you *want* cross-machine | no mandatory server / cloud dependency |
| **First-class typed signals**: corrections, test pass/fail, tool-loops, git commit/revert, todo completions, permission replies, cross-turn contradictions, idle sweeps, plus auto **skill-refresh** | the gap every other tool leaves to probabilistic extraction |
| **Cross-harness by design**: Codex writes a learning, a later Claude session reads it | single-harness / MCP-bolted memory |
| **Markdown source of truth**, volatile signals in a DB sidecar → clean git diffs, reviewable in a PR | opaque DB/vector blobs |

The honest line: on the *no-extra-key* axis alone, claude-mem ties reflect (it also reuses Claude's
auth). reflect's separation is the **combination**: selective + no-key + local + typed-signals +
cross-harness + MIT: which no single competitor matches.
