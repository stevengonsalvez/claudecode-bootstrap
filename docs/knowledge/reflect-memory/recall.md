[Why build, not adopt](/knowledge/reflect-memory/comparison).

:::note[Examples are illustrative]
The `reflect search …` examples and their results below are representative, hand-authored to show
the behaviour: not pasted from a specific live KB run. Every feature is backed by a behavioural
proof under [`tests/eval/behavioral/proofs/`](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory/tree/main/tests/eval/behavioral/proofs)
that exercises it with the knob **on and off**.
:::

## Memory end to end: one learning's journey

Follow one correction from the moment it happens to the moment it saves you weeks later.

**1 · Capture.** Mid-session you tell the agent: *"no: don't bump the shared `payments.proto`
without regenerating the clients, it broke staging last time."* A `PostToolUse`/`Stop` hook detects
the correction signal, slices just the relevant dialogue window (not the whole 100k-token transcript),
and the drain writes a structured learning:

```yaml
---
title: "Regenerate gRPC clients after editing payments.proto"
category: reliability
tags: [grpc, proto, payments, codegen]
confidence: 0.8
project_id: billing-svc
problem: "Bumped payments.proto without regenerating clients"
fix: "Run `make proto-gen` after any .proto edit; CI now gates on it"
rule: "Never ship a .proto change without regenerated clients"
---
```
Alongside it, an entity sidecar records `payments.proto , [prevents]→ staging outage`.

**2 · Index.** `reflect reindex` embeds the note (vector arm), adds its entities + edges to the
GraphRAG graph (graph arm), and registers it in the BM25 index (QMD arm). It's now reachable three
different ways.

**3 · Recall: three weeks later, a different session.** A new teammate's agent opens `billing-svc`
and is about to edit `payments.proto`. **SessionStart** fires, builds a query from project + branch
context, and runs hybrid recall: the **vector arm** matches on meaning, the **BM25 arm** matches the
literal `payments.proto`, the **graph arm** hops the `prevents` edge: **RRF** fuses the rankings,
the **cross-encoder** reranks, the **OOD gate** confirms relevance, the **token budget** packs it in.

Before the agent writes a line, it sees: *"Regenerate gRPC clients after editing payments.proto , 
broke staging last time; run `make proto-gen`."* The mistake never happens twice. That whole chain , 
capture → index → fuse → rerank → gate → inject: is what the 57 ports tune.

## Retrieval arms

The parallel signals that find candidates, plus the post-fusion shapers that order them.

<div class="rm-cards two">
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">R1 ★</span> Graph-expansion arm · <code>RECALL_GRAPH_ARM</code> (on)</div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> A 3rd arm walks the entity graph and fuses notes you never matched lexically. <em>e.g.</em> “why does checkout call <code>recalcTax</code> twice?” → hops <code>caused_by</code> to the EU-VAT rounding note.</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> Only the lexically-matching note; you “fix” the perf and re-introduce the rounding bug the double-call fixed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">R5 ★</span> Temporal arm · <code>RECALL_TEMPORAL_ARM</code> (on)</div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> When a date phrase is found (R6), a 4th arm fuses notes whose timestamp falls in the window. <em>e.g.</em> “what did we decide last week about auth”.</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> In-window notes get crowded out by topical arms; recent decisions don't surface.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">R6</span> Query-time date parsing · <code>RECALL_TEMPORAL</code> (on)</div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> Regex-extracts “last week” / “in march” / “since 2026-01-01” into a real date range that feeds R5.</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> “last week” is just two more keywords; temporal intent silently dropped.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">R2 ★</span> Cross-encoder rerank · <code>RECALL_CROSS_ENCODER</code> (on)</div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> Re-reads the top-20 jointly with the query (local MiniLM CE) and re-sorts by <em>meaning</em>. “flaky test in the auth suite” lifts the real answer over a keyword-similar “auth token format”.</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> The keyword-similar-but-wrong note wins rank 1; right prior art misses a tight budget.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rm-card">

    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> Packs ranked notes by estimated tokens until the budget is hit, instead of a fixed top-k. <code>reflect search "deploy steps" --max-tokens 1500</code>.</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> A fixed top-k blows the window on a verbose corpus; long notes evict the user's own files.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Relevance gates

<div class="rm-cards two">
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">R7 ★</span> OOD relevance gate · <code>--min-overlap</code></div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> Measures query-term coverage of the top hit; below threshold it injects <strong>nothing</strong> (<code>ood_gated</code>). <code>--min-overlap 0.3</code> in a fresh repo.</p>

    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> A per-arm floor applied <em>before</em> RRF (arm scores aren't comparable). <code>RECALL_ARM_BM25_MIN_SCORE=0.15</code> drops weak BM25 hits without nuking strong graph hits. Seed via <code>reflect calibrate-thresholds</code>.</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> One global cutoff either lets BM25 noise through or starves the graph arm.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Ranking & affinity boosts

Secondary signals that break ties: each bounded so it can nudge, never hijack.

<div class="rm-cards two">
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">R8</span> Bounded multiplicative boosts · <code>RECALL_*_ALPHA</code></div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> Each signal applied as <code>1+α·(norm−0.5)</code>, clamped to ±α/2: recency / confidence / tags / proof break ties only (defaults 0.2/0.2/0.2/0.1).</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> Unbounded boosts let “most recent” bury a 2-year-old note that perfectly answers the query.</p>

    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> Cross-project recall treats every project equally; a foreign note outranks your own.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">S3</span> Numeric confidence ranking · <code>--field confidence_num</code></div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> Stores continuous 0–1 confidence as the canonical ranking value; HIGH/MED/LOW are display buckets.</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> Coarse tiers can't separate two “HIGH” notes; ranking loses a real signal.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">S4</span> Provenance / proof-count · <code>RECALL_PROOF_ALPHA</code> (0.1)</div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> First-class <code>proof_count</code> provenance nudges ranking ±5% and is projectable via <code>--field proof_count</code>.</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> A note proven 12 times ranks identically to an unverified one.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Scope: sharding & isolation

<div class="rm-cards two">
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">R15</span> Per-project sharding · <code>--global</code> / <code>RECALL_GLOBAL</code></div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> Each project has its own nano-graphrag shard; recall defaults to the current project's. <code>--global</code> unions across all.</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> Every project's recall is polluted by every other's; the relevant local note drowns.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">A6</span> Branch-aware isolation · <code>RECALL_BRANCH</code> / <code>--all-branches</code></div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> Within a project, each git branch/worktree gets a sub-shard; recall pins to the current branch.</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> A speculative note from an abandoned <code>feat/y</code> surfaces as fact while you work <code>feat/x</code>.</p>

## Recall modes & inject

    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> Every recall pays full-body cost for every candidate; deep digs become token-prohibitive.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">R10</span> 3-tier hierarchical inject · <code>REFLECT_TIERED_INJECT</code></div>

  </div>
  <div class="rm-card">

    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> Warm-project boots needlessly spawn the full pipeline: slow and noisy.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">M7</span> Knowledge-corpus Q&amp;A · <code>reflect corpus build</code></div>

    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> One hard-coded taxonomy; research/writing workflows can't retune what's captured/surfaced.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">O3</span> Persona / preference answer · always-on</div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> A high-confidence distilled field (e.g. <code>testing_style='TDD'</code>) answers an open-domain query directly. “what testing style does this project use?”</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> The question falls through to generic recall; a known team fact isn't answered crisply.</p>

  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">R20</span> Skills-index query · always-on</div>
    <p><span class="lbl">Does</span> A queryable sqlite index of installed skills (name/tags/summary) replaces per-query SKILL.md scanning; feeds R10/R11.</p>
    <p class="without"><span class="lbl">Without it</span> Tiered inject rescans every SKILL.md per query; slower, and never matches an unindexed skill.</p>

## Caching, dedup & negative-recall

<div class="rm-cards two">
  <div class="rm-card">
    <div class="h"><span class="id">R9</span> Fuzzy cache tier · <code>RECALL_FUZZY_CACHE</code> (on)</div>

## Worked examples

Illustrative command → output for the marquee arms (representative, not a live run).

### R1 · graph-expansion
```
$ reflect search "why does checkout call recalcTax twice"
✓ recalcTax is idempotent but expensive            (vector + bm25)
✓ double-call fixes an EU-VAT rounding bug (a1b2c3) (graph: caused_by hop)   ← never matched lexically
```

### R2 · cross-encoder rerank
```
$ reflect search "flaky test in the auth suite"
  RRF rank 1:  auth token format …            ← keyword-heavy, wrong
→ CE rank 1:  auth integration test flaky under parallel xdist   ← answers the question
```

### R5 · temporal arm
```
$ reflect search "what's our current API auth"
✓ migrated to server-side sessions (Jun)   ← temporal arm lifts recent
  we use JWT (Apr)                          ← older, more-cited, demoted
```

### R7 · OOD gate
```
$ reflect search "totally unrelated topic" --min-overlap 0.3
∅ ood_gated: top hit overlap 0.08 < 0.3 → injected nothing (no least-bad junk)
```

### M1 · staged recall
```
$ reflect index "tokio panic on shutdown"        # token-capped id+title rows
  [a17] Graceful tokio shutdown ordering   score 0.82
  [c44] Abort vs cancel on JoinHandle      score 0.71
$ reflect hydrate a17 c44                          # full bodies only for what you picked
```
