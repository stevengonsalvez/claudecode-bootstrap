# Attention surface — progress log

Contract: `docs/plans/attention-surface-spec.md`. Run protocol:
`docs/plans/attention-surface-goal.md`.

## Grounding corrections to the goal's "current state"

The goal doc was grounded against a different tree. Verified 2026-09-04 on
`f/attention-surface`:

| Goal claim | Actual |
|---|---|
| `fleet_panel.rs` is 2177 lines | 2159 lines, 9 `ainb_plugin_hangar` references — claim holds in substance |
| hangar `screen/inbox.rs` is 1652 lines, "the ONE attention surface" | 324 lines, a read-only `hangar/inbox_list` renderer. It is the daemon's issue/comment inbox, not the notification attention queue |
| `SupervisorMode::Lite` / `Controller::LiteScanner` appear 16x in `fleet/atc/supervisor.rs` | **THE GOAL WAS RIGHT AND THIS ROW WAS WRONG.** Both symbols exist, in that exact file. The original entry here claimed neither existed and that criterion 1's `rg`-zero gate was already satisfied; it was written from a search run in the wrong working directory (`crates/` resolves under `ainb-tui/`, not the repo root, and the miss read as an absence). Corrected in phase 9, where the deletion is real work rather than an audit |
| `ainb fleet atc supervise`, `--set lite` | **Also wrong for the same reason.** Both exist |
| `heartbeat-state.json` `continue_counts` | exists (`fleet/atc/heartbeat.rs`), still the JSON ledger |
| `screen/fleet.rs:1354` `FleetMode::Start` (`t`) | exists, now at `fleet.rs:1340` |
| host `t` key | `GoToAbtop` on HomeScreen — NOT the Codex start form, and NOT deleted |
| `atc_retry` table | exists since migration `0028`, `instance_name TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES atc_instance(name)` |

Consequence: phase 9's deletion half is mostly already done; its real work is
the daemon retry sweep. Recorded so the final report does not claim a deletion
it did not perform.

## Open-question decisions

All eight resolved here per the run protocol's autonomy envelope.

### Q1 — `f` and `b` are freed. Rebind, or leave unbound?

**Leave unbound, and delete their HomeScreen tiles.**

Muscle memory is the whole risk. An operator who presses `f` today expects the
Fleet panel; rebinding `f` to a different verb means their reflex fires
something they did not ask for. Unbound plus a tile that no longer advertises
`[f]` is the honest signal that the surface moved. Rebinding waits a release,
by which time the reflex is gone.

### Q2 — `atc_retry.instance_name` FK: relax it, or a synthetic instance?

**Synthetic reserved instance, registered idempotently at daemon boot.**

SQLite cannot drop a foreign key in place; relaxing it means rebuilding
`atc_retry` and copying every real ATC's ledger, which risks live escalation
history for a cosmetic constraint change. A reserved instance keeps the FK,
keeps `retry_get` / `retry_list` / `record_continue` / `mark_escalated` /
`reset_retry` byte-identical (zero repo churn), and gives the sweep its own
ledger namespace so its counts can never collide with a real ATC's counts for
the same session.

### Q3 — Sweep cadence: keep lite's 5s, or align to a daemon tick?

**30s, its own interval, with an env override for tests.**

5s was right for lite because lite was a foreground scanner with nothing else
to do; at 5s the sweep re-reads the whole ERR roster twelve times a minute for
a condition that moves on the scale of an API backoff. The general sweeper's
60s is too slow — a rate-limited agent then idles a full minute before the
`continue` lands. 30s matches the daemon's existing presence pass, is a 6x
reduction in wake rate against lite, and keeps worst-case idle inside the
transient-error window. The env override exists so a tripwire can drive the
sweep in about a second instead of waiting 30.

### Q4 — Retry cap: reuse `DEFAULT_ERR_RETRY_CAP`, or a new config key?

**Reuse `DEFAULT_ERR_RETRY_CAP`. No new key.**

The sweep and the ATC heartbeat must escalate at the same point. Two caps that
can drift is precisely the split-brain this epic exists to delete. The constant
is one line if it ever needs to move.

### Q5 — Which read tools does `help` mode get?

**Exactly `ainb_fleet_tools::guardrail::READ_TOOLS`: `fleet_status`,
`session_needs`, `session_transcript`. Nothing else.**

These three are the entire read surface that exists today, they are already in
the classifier's table, and they are already covered by the injection audit
(`model_supplied_justification_cannot_move_a_verdict`). Inventing memory /
skills / repo / docs read tools to answer this question would widen the
injection surface AND add a tool surface the spec never asked for. `guarded`
adds the write tools behind confirm cards; `yolo` promotes the confirm-class
tools via `with_auto_overrides`, which already drops `kill` because `kill` is
`NEVER_OVERRIDABLE` — so `kill` stays off the automatic path in every mode,
including yolo.

### Q6 — Does `yolo` persist across restarts?

**No. Every channel's stored mode is normalised yolo to guarded at daemon
start.** `help` and `guarded` persist untouched.

A dangerous mode that survives a restart is a mode the operator forgets is on.
The restart is the natural revocation point, and the pane's red banner makes
re-arming it a one-keystroke, visible act.

### Q7 — Adapter registry: new `adapters.toml`, or a config section?

**Neither — the registry already exists.** `PoolConfig::from_config()` reads
`[acp.adapters.*]` out of the host `config.toml` today
(`crates/ainb-hangar-daemon/src/acp_pool.rs`). Phase 7 exposes what is there
over RPC and validates the copilot's `provider` string against it. A second
file would be a second source of truth for a registry that already has one.

### Q8 — Is the `log` tab's per-session scoping enough?

**Yes.** The cross-session notification history the host `b` Inbox provided is
already carried by the hangar plugin's `I` Inbox tab, which is explicitly out
of scope and stays. Adding a second cross-session view to the `log` tab would
recreate the duplication this epic is deleting.

## Deviations from the spec, with reasons

Each is a place the spec asked for something the tree cannot currently
express. None is a shortcut around work.

| Spec line | What shipped | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Insta: chip strip "at 80 and 100 columns, both themes" | 80, 100 and 42 columns; one palette | `ui_preferences.theme` is persisted config that **no component reads** — the palette is hardcoded consts in every renderer. There is one rendered theme to snapshot. 42 is added because it is the real default sidebar width and the only one that exercises the name-truncation path |
| Left-pane mock titled `Sessions · 2 need you` | `Workspaces (4) · 2 need you` | `(4)` is the workspace count and the filter's feedback loop; calling the panel "Sessions" while showing a workspace count is worse than keeping the noun. The badge — the part the spec is actually specifying — is verbatim |
| Header carries the elsewhere count | Own trailing row, `N waiting elsewhere` | At the default 38-column sidebar a fourth title item truncated mid-word to `1 el`. Proven in a real tmux capture, then moved |
| "Hangar daemon down → one banner line on the sessions header, not two" | Deferred to phase 5 | "Not two" is only meaningful once the host Fleet panel (the second banner) is deleted. Until then the daemon-down state is carried by the dimmed chip and its reason, which is the part that is not deferrable |
| `Tab` cycles the strip | `Tab` cycles it, `Shift+Tab` walks back, and `SwitchPaneFocus` is gone | `Tab` was pane focus. Focus now FOLLOWS the tab (composer tabs take input, `preview`/`log` do not), so the one thing that key bought is a consequence of this one. Two keys for one concept is the ambiguity the strip removes |
| Footer: "1-9 attach from every tab" | True except inside a live composer, where the footer says so | A `3` typed into a message has to be a `3`. Advertising attach there advertises a key that types a character |
| ERR chip from a local producer | Wired and unit-tested; reachable from the daemon (`error` / `escalation`) and from `SessionStatus::Error` | No local hook event classifies as an error — `classify_attention` has three outcomes and none of them is one. Inventing a fourth would be a producer the spec did not ask for |
| Copilot header: `◀ e cycle`, `◀ o`, `◀ g` on bare letters | `⌥e` / `⌥o` / `⌥g`, rendered that way | The copilot composer takes focus the moment the conversation opens, so a bare `e` is an `e` in a half-typed message. The tripwire proved the dials were unreachable in the state an operator is usually in. Alt never types, so one binding works in both halves of the pane; a bare key advertised on the header that silently does nothing most of the time is worse than a modified one |
| `mode help` → "no write tools in the table" | Refused at the classifier; the advertised MCP tool table is unchanged | The tool table is announced once at `initialize`, and the dial can move mid-session. A table pinned at spawn goes stale the instant an operator turns the dial, and a stale PERMISSIVE table is worse than an accurate refusal. `CopilotMode::tools()` exists and is tested as the projection; the enforcement point is the live daemon-side classifier, which reads the channel row on every call |
| Broadcast as its own strip tab | `thread` becomes `broadcast (N)` while rows are checked | The spec's strip is five tabs and a sixth would not be one. The codebase already has the rule this needs — "checked rows win over the cursor", which `Enter` and `r` follow on this screen — so the checkbox means one thing everywhere rather than one thing per verb. The label and the Enter hint both carry the count, because "send message" is a dangerous thing for a footer to say when the message is going to four sessions |
| Broadcast through the chat surface | Its own small pane, not a `ChatHost` | A thread and the copilot are CONVERSATIONS: durable scope, timeline, a page that reloads it. `fleet/broadcast` fans one text out and answers with N receipts and there is nothing to page afterwards. Modelling it as a conversation means inventing a scope for it, which is exactly the named channel the copilot tab already offers |
| Channels as a picker inside the copilot tab | A `channels` row on the header | What the spec's own header mock draws. A picker implies switching the pane's conversation, which is the `Channel` topic the chat surface already has and the F tab already drives; the name is the way back to one, and listing them is what the copilot pane owes |
| Model picker from the adapter's `config_options` | From a declared `[acp.adapters.<name>].models` list | ACP has no model-discovery call, so an adapter cannot be ASKED what it runs. `config_options` are values already set, not choices. A declared list is the only honest source; empty means the header says "adapter default" rather than offering a guess that would fail at `session/set_config_option` |

## Pre-existing breakage fixed on the way

`cargo test -p ainb --lib` failed **9 tests on `main` (296065a3)** whenever run
from a pane `ainb` itself had spawned; green on a clean CI runner. Verified by
running the baseline in a throwaway worktree: identical 9 failures.

One root, eight cascades. `export_env_bridge` clears any variable still holding
the parent's exact planted value before publishing its own, and
`AINB_BRIDGED_VARS` is how it recognises one. A pane spawned by the TUI inherits
`AINB_FLEET_STATE_STALE_MS=0` as a parent plant, so the "user override" the test
sets is stripped and re-planted as the bridge's own — the legacy rung it asserts
on becomes unreachable. It then panicked before its cleanup, leaving the
process-global snapshot and the `BRIDGED` set installed; the next test read a
self-planted `AINB_HEADROOM_PORT` as unset, panicked holding `ENV_LOCK`, and
poisoned it for six more.

Fixed with an RAII guard covering `AINB_BRIDGED_VARS` and releasing on unwind
(`43561551`). 2150/2150 lib tests now pass, parallel and single-threaded.

## Bugs found by the tripwires, not by the tests

| Bug | How it surfaced | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| A failed **option** send wrote the option's label into the free-text composer and moved the cursor there, so a retry would have sent typed text instead of the option | Daemon-up tripwire picked the second option, watched the send fail, and found `api/src/db.sqlite` in the composer | `355d582e` — only a typed answer is a restorable draft |
| The `ask` pane opened with no question on a locally-produced row, and with the composer unfocused when the request had no options | Daemon-down tripwire typed into it and `d` opened the delete-session dialog | Local chips now carry the hook's own `message`; `retarget` focuses the composer when there is nothing to pick |
| A failed `attention/list` poll emptied the row map, so one socket timeout made every live ASK vanish for five seconds | Tab-strip tripwire failed one run in seven, the `ask` tab dimmed because its chip had briefly gone | `f40e09f7` — rows carry across a failed poll and grey out instead, which is the shape the spec asked for all along |
| `tmux_sessions_at` interpolated a cwd into a tmux FORMAT string, where `#(...)` runs a shell command | Background security review of `c577cbb0` | `391f0607` — deleted; it had no callers and the `N waiting elsewhere` row already serves the case |
| The elsewhere count truncated to `1 el` in the panel title | Phase-2 tripwire assertion on a real 38-column capture | Moved to its own full-width row |
| The copilot dials were unreachable: bare `e` / `o` / `g` went into the chat composer, which holds focus from the moment the conversation opens | Phase-7 tripwire pressed `e` and watched the engine not move, with no failure line either | Moved to `⌥`, which never types, and the header renders the modifier |
| `fleet/adapter_list` read the config registry while `copilot_configure` and `acp_session_create` fell back to the hardcoded two-name floor: the picker OFFERED an operator's configured adapter and the write then refused it as `unknown adapter` | Phase-7 tripwire cycled to an adapter that exists only in `[acp.adapters]` and got the refusal rendered on the pane | One `adapter_registry()` resolution now serves the list and both writes |
| The retry sweep's transient gate scanned the WHOLE hook envelope: `notify.sh` builds it as `payload: .` and `UserPromptSubmit`/`PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` are registered, so a prompt, a tool's arguments and a tool's OUTPUT all reached it. The patterns are bare word-boundary substrings, so an agent that merely read or grepped a file containing `ECONNRESET` armed its own auto-`continue`, fleet-wide and unattended. `ainb-fleet-core`'s own `errors.rs` contains all seven | Adversarial review of the branch, opus. Not a green-suite failure: every sweep test passed, because they all seed `StopFailure` | `19771d3d` — both bounds pushed into the SQL: error-bearing event types only, and only events around the ERROR transition. Each has a test proved to fail when its own guard is removed |
| `ainb fleet daemon`, the uncapped legacy watcher, refused to race a live ATC but knew nothing about the new sweep. The two gates left a hole exactly where they met: with NO ATC, both ran | CLI parity audit after Stevie asked whether everything was retrofitted | `a71b3d69` — it now refuses while the daemon is serving, asked of the socket rather than a flag |
| Two ATC heartbeat builders had no callers and skipped the `<untrusted>` fence the live one applies, leaving an unfenced prompt path for the next caller who reached for the shorter name | `/simplify` pass, verified by grep after its rustc evidence turned out not to hold | `71642b03` — deleted, with `RetryLedger` |
| The help overlay and the panel legend still documented `b Inbox` and `f Fleet control panel`, both deleted in phases 5 and 6 | Full `--tests` sweep; earlier passes had filtered tripwires out the way CI's Test job does | `065d5a2b` — entries replaced by the pane that took over from both, and both tripwires now assert their ABSENCE |
| CI invoked two deleted tripwires by NAME and had been failing on a missing test binary ever since phases 5 and 6 | The first CI run that actually dispatched after the merge | `cafc4378` — replaced by the sessions tab strip and the copilot picker, the surfaces that took the work over |
| `acp_session::ensure` validated a provider against the two-name built-in floor while `fleet/adapter_list` read the config registry: the picker OFFERED an operator's configured adapter and the mint behind it refused the same name | The copilot tripwire on CI, not locally — the local green run predated the merge that put `ensure` in this path, and only the lib suite was re-run after the rewire | `908b5500` — one resolution beside the pool that owns the registry, used by the list and by every write |

| The `ask` pane held ONE outcome field for every question. It was cleared on retarget and written by whichever send worker landed last, so answering A and moving to B painted **A's failure under B's question**, and returning to A showed nothing at all. My own fix `e0684d6b` for the double-send moved this defect rather than closing it: before, the outcome vanished into an orphaned inbox; after, the surface actively attributed one question's failure to another | Adversarial re-review of my own fix, opus. Not a green-suite failure: every unit passed, because none of them navigated between two questions | `ba0c863b` — the outcome is keyed by request. The `InFlight` entry doubles as the double-send latch, so the view and the fact cannot disagree, and `in_flight_request` is deleted. Proved by falsification: re-filing the landed outcome under `self.request` turns the new test red |
| `fleet/copilot_configure` retires the old ACP session before minting its replacement, so a mint that failed left the copilot channel with **no live session and no way back** — the engine picker was the one control that could end the conversation | Same review. The ordering cannot be swapped: a live session holds the scope the replacement needs, so `ensure` would return the old row instead of minting | `e54149fc` — the row is restored to its captured pre-swap state on the `Err` path. The test injects the failure by blanking `cwd` in the store, and goes red when the restore writes the wrong state |
| The chat page opened the copilot with a get-or-create that had to NAME an adapter, so it named a constant. After an operator swapped engines, `acp_session::ensure` refused the mismatched name with `ScopeHeld` — opening the chat page was refused outright, not silently reverted as first reported | Same review, symptom traced further than the report claimed | `b7a88989` — `provider` is optional and omitting it means "the adapter this scope already runs", which only the daemon can answer. `COPILOT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER` deleted |

## Phase 8: where each rehomed verb went

| Verb | Old home | New home | Exercised by |
|---|---|---|---|
| broadcast compose + send | panel `b`, with its own recipient picker | `thread` tab while rows are checked; recipients ARE the checkboxes | `tripwire_sessions_broadcast` (two checked rows, both legs rendered) |
| broadcast recipient picker | panel modal, second roster | DELETED. The sessions list's checkboxes are the only selection model | same |
| named channels list | panel `N` create form | `channels` row on the copilot header | `an_unanswered_channel_list_is_not_an_empty_one` |
| new-ATC name prompt | panel `FleetPanelNewAtc*` events | Daemons screen `Provision`, which already provisioned an instance and brought it up without one existing | pre-existing Daemons menu tests; `rg FleetPanelNewAtc` is ZERO |
| managed-Codex start (`t`) | hangar plugin `FleetMode::Start` | DELETED outright. `ainb run` and the new-session flow are the spawn paths, and they know about worktrees, hooks and the session registry, which this form did not | `the_retired_start_key_opens_nothing` |
| Codex remote-control | — | already the default (`[codex] app_server = desktop`), no UI | n/a |
| roster, fleet-wide operator views | — | hangar plugin `F` tab, untouched | its own reducer tests |

## Parity: every verb the deleted Fleet panel had

The spec makes this a must-pass gate — each verb is **rehomed and exercised**,
or **explicitly deleted**. Nothing is left implicit.

| Panel verb | Key | Outcome | Exercised by |
|---|---|---|---|
| move row selection | `↑ ↓ k j` | rehomed: the sessions list's own selection | every sessions tripwire |
| move the ASK option cursor | `Tab` `⇧Tab` | rehomed: `↑ ↓` in the `ask` pane | `tripwire_sessions_answer_daemon_up` (picks the SECOND option) |
| answer the selected ASK | `Enter` `a` | rehomed: `Enter` on the `ask` pane | `..._answer_daemon_up`, `..._answer_daemon_down` |
| approve / deny a permission request | `y` `n` | rehomed: `approve`/`deny` options in the `ask` pane, delivered through notifyd's broker | `tripwire_sessions_approve_unblocks_hook` |
| open the copilot conversation | `m` | rehomed: the `copilot` tab | `tripwire_fleet_chat_screen` |
| open the selected session's thread | `M` | rehomed: the `thread` tab | `tripwire_fleet_session_thread` |
| answer a guardrail confirm card | `⇥` then `y` | rehomed: `⇧⇥` then `y` in the `copilot` tab | `tripwire_fleet_chat_screen` |
| force-refresh from the daemon | `F5` | rehomed as automatic: the attention poller's 5s cadence, with rows carried across a failed poll | `tripwire_sessions_daemon_attention` |
| back to the previous screen | `q` `Esc` | unchanged | `tripwire_fleet_chat_screen` (Esc leaves the conversation) |
| restart the selected session | `R` | already on the sessions screen (`E` restart) | pre-existing |
| roster lenses 1-5 | `1`-`5` | rehomed in spirit: the sessions list's own `F` filter. The fleet-wide lens view itself is the hangar plugin's `F` tab | pre-existing |
| reconcile a Claude interview | `r` | **not rehomed** — hangar plugin `F` tab, untouched | plugin's own tests |
| the multi-question vertical-card interview | `Enter` on a multi-ASK | **not rehomed** — hangar plugin `F` tab, untouched. The sessions screen answers one question at a time from the daemon's payload | plugin's own tests |
| ACP session visible in a roster | — | **not rehomed** — an ACP session has no host session row; it is counted by the `N waiting elsewhere` row, and the roster is the plugin's `F` tab | `tripwire_sessions_daemon_attention` (the elsewhere count) |
| attach to an EXACT `session:window.pane` | `→` | **deleted.** The sessions screen attaches by session, which is the same thing for an ainb session (one pane) | — |
| broadcast to the current lens | `B` | **rehomed in phase 8** — the sessions list's existing checkboxes | phase 8 restores `tripwire_fleet_broadcast_channel` against the copilot tab |
| create a named channel | `N` | **rehomed in phase 8** — the channels list inside the `copilot` tab | as above |
| new-ATC name prompt | `n` | **rehomed in phase 8** — the Daemons screen | as above |
| managed-Codex start form | `t` | **deleted in phase 8.** Codex remote control is already the default (`[codex] app_server = desktop`) | — |

## Parity: the deleted host Inbox

| Inbox verb | Key | Outcome | Exercised by |
|---|---|---|---|
| this session's notification history | — | rehomed: the `log` tab | `tripwire_sessions_tab_strip` reads a real hook row back |
| the fleet-wide notification list | `b` | **not rehomed** — the hangar plugin's `I` tab, untouched. Rebuilding it here recreates the duplication the epic deletes | plugin's own tests |
| unread badge on the menu bar | — | **deleted.** The needs-you badge on the sessions header is the count that matters: what is BLOCKING an agent, not what is unread | `tripwire_sessions_attention_chips` |
| dismiss / archive / agent filter | `d` `C` `a` `p` | **deleted** with the screen | — |
| jump to the row's tmux session | `Enter` | rehomed: the attach digits, which work from every tab | `tripwire_sessions_tab_strip` footer assertion |

| Keying the outcome by request threw the operator's TYPED answer away whenever the failure landed while they were looking at a different question: the draft lived on the in-flight entry, and settling that entry replaced it. The restore then fired only for a failure they happened to be watching — and a send slow enough to fail is one they are likely to have walked away from | Second adversarial pass on `ba0c863b`, opus. My fix for the misattribution introduced it | `1d7b7039` — the draft rides on `Failed` itself, and one `restore_failed_draft` serves both the outcome landing in view and the operator returning to it. Red when the `retarget` call is removed |

| A failed engine swap left the guardrail where the swap had put it. The client only adopts a mode from an `Applied` outcome, so a configure that loosened to `yolo` and then failed armed it underneath a header still reading `guarded`: `spawn_session`, `interrupt` and `archive` reached `Auto` and fired with no confirm card, for an operator who believed they took one. `kill` was never at risk, being unoverridable | Adversarial review, opus, part 2 of 5. The comment justifying mode-before-swap was right about tightening and inverted about loosening | `17ee6a6b` — a failed configure now changes nothing in either direction, and the failure path also converges the restored session, because teardown only signals the actor and does nothing at all when there was no live handle |
| The retry sweep's transient gate was still fooled, by the envelope's own `cwd` and `project`: patterns are word-boundary matches and `-` and `/` are non-word characters, so a worktree named `econnreset-repro` matched on its path and every failure on that session read as transient. Bounding the event TYPES could not close this, because the path rides inside the very event that reports the error | Same review, part 3. My earlier fix `19771d3d` narrowed the aperture and I recorded it as closed | `d5735835` — the gate reads one named field instead of the record. `acp_error` deleted with it: nothing emits that string, so it was implying wire-session coverage the sweep does not have |
| `⌥c` offered a cancel for a turn that had long ended. A delivery leg leaves PENDING daemon-side and nothing the page reads brings that back, so the key stayed armed for the life of the pane — the whole TUI session, for the singleton copilot — and aimed an interrupt at whatever was running by then; on a fan-out, at every recipient | Same review, part 5. The verb is this branch's own, from `58508afd` | `dd9a5139` bounds it to one turn deadline and stops a second press minting another cancel; `66b692dc` names the rest. NOT closed: see the open item below |

## What is proved by tmux, and what is not

The contract is that every acceptance check drives the real TUI. It holds for
all ten phases. Three review-found fixes landed after those checks, and the
evidence behind them is uneven enough to name:

| Fix | tmux | Unit | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ba0c863b` outcome per question | `tripwire_sessions_answer_outcome_per_question` | 3 tests, one falsified | The tripwire pins the half that is deterministic |
| `b7a88989` unnamed provider | no | daemon test, falsified | |
| `e54149fc` restore on failed mint | no | daemon test, falsified | |

The new tripwire seeds two waiting sessions and gives only the second a real
tmux pane, so the first session's answer fails for real. It then walks to the
second session and asserts its pane reports NOTHING, and walks back and asserts
the failure is still on the question it belongs to.

It does **not** pin the misattribution itself, and this is a limit rather than
an omission: reproducing that needs the outcome to land while the pane is on
the other question, and a tmux send to an absent pane fails in milliseconds —
far faster than an operator can navigate. There is no deterministic way to
drive that window from tmux with the fixtures this branch has. The unit test
covers it instead, and was proved by re-introducing the defect and watching it
go red. Recorded here rather than left as an implied claim that tmux covers
everything.

## Open, and deliberately not fixed here

| Item | Why it is left | What closing it needs |
|---|---|---|
| `chat_cancel_turns_blocking`'s version check is vacuous — it re-reads `fleet/snapshot` immediately before the write, which removes the staleness property optimistic concurrency exists for | Closing it means a new field on `FleetMessageDelivery` that the daemon populates when it builds the leg. That is a wire change on the message path at the end of the epic, and the exposure is now bounded to one turn deadline rather than the life of the pane | Carry the version the leg was CREATED at from the send through `ChatIntent::CancelTurn`, and pass that as `expected_version` instead of re-reading it |
| The retry sweep is Claude-hook-only: a wire session's ERROR event type is the raw method (`turn/failed`, `thread/error`), none of which is in the allowlist, so Codex and ACP sessions always land in `skipped_opaque` | It fails CLOSED, which is the right direction for a gate that types at an unattended agent. Widening what auto-`continue` reaches is a deliberate behaviour change and needs its own verification, not a longer list | A predicate mirroring the state machine that set ERROR, landed with tests that prove which sessions newly qualify |

## Suite status

`cargo test --workspace`: **104 test binaries, 103 pass.**

The one failure is `tripwire_new_session_agent_pills_visible`, and it is
environmental rather than a code failure. The pane it captures shows the
new-session dialog stuck on:

```
✖ Authentication failed - check your git credentials
Launch is disabled — Esc to pick another repository
```

so the Agent row it asserts on is never reached. That message comes from
`git/remote_repo_manager.rs`, which this branch does not touch; the test file
is byte-identical to `origin/main`; and this branch changes no file under
`crates/ainb-core/src/git/` or `components/new_session.rs`. No CI job runs the
binary either — the `Test` job filters `not binary(/^tripwire_/)` and the
named-tripwire steps do not include it — which is why it went unseen.

Two OTHER tripwires in that same CI-ungated position were red for the same
reason and are fixed here (`b4d9d7f2`): both demanded a `fleet daemon` row
that `probe.rs` deliberately withholds while that daemon is stopped, a rule
main pins in its own unit test. They now assert the contract that holds.

The `ainb-plugin-cts-v2::real_plugin_axes` guard noted earlier did not trip on
this run.

## Published pages

| Page | Where | Lock |
|---|---|---|
| The attention surface | <https://explainers.stevengonsalvez.com/attention-surface/> (also <https://fancy-temple-hw39.here.now/>) | open |

Open because the config's `protect_rule` says so in as many words: "Own
open-source tooling explainers (ainb, reflect, hangar, popajob, career-ops,
cerebro) stay public." Nothing on the page is not already in this public repo's
commits. Source committed at `explainers/attention-surface.html`.

Recordings, one per user-visible phase, all driven through a real `ainb tui`
in tmux and read back off the pane:

| Phase | Recording | Fixture |
|---|---|---|
| 1-2 chips | `attention-chips.gif` | no daemon |
| 3 tab strip | `attention-tabs.gif` | no daemon |
| 4 answering | `attention-answer.gif` | no daemon |
| 5-6 deletions | `attention-deletions.gif` | no daemon, as absence in the help overlay |
| 8 broadcast | `attention-broadcast.gif` | no daemon; the send refuses and says why |
| 7 copilot | **none** | four takes, all ended on `preview` |
| 9 sweep | **none possible** | no TUI surface |
| 10 ACP chat | **none** | daemon-side; visible only as the chat page opening |

All driven by `scripts/attention-surface-demo.sh` (`--daemon` when a verb is
daemon-owned) through `docs/assets/screenshots/attention-*.tape`.

### The demo runs against its own tmux server, and must

The sessions screen lists every tmux session it cannot account for under
"Other tmux". The first six recordings were therefore carrying the operator's
REAL session names — including shotclubhouse ones, which this repo's own
publishing rule locks — and one take fired `t` and rendered a full abtop
screen of live sessions and prompts. Caught in frame review before anything
was published; every gif was deleted and re-recorded.

The fix is `TMUX_TMPDIR` on a private socket with `TMUX` unset, so a client
cannot rejoin the host's server. Two details cost a take each: the socket path
must be SHORT (the mktemp home exceeded the 104-byte unix socket limit, and
tmux fails with "File name too long"), and the fixture sessions need the
`tmux_` prefix or ainb lists them a second time as unmanaged.

### Takes that were thrown away

| Take | Discarded because |
|---|---|
| answer 1 | Seeded onboarding version was a hardcoded `0.0.0`, so the TUI ran the setup wizard |
| answer 2 | Two Tabs from `preview` lands on `thread`; the answer went into the thread composer |
| answer 3 | `Down` never moved the session: `thread` and `copilot` swallow the arrows |
| answer 4 | The walk moved one row, which is the same worktree's other session — the same question |
| broadcast 1 | Ran without a daemon before that was the deliberate choice; refused honestly but showed nothing working |
| broadcast 2 | Daemon bring-up pushed the tape out of step; keys fired as session shortcuts and starred a workspace |
| copilot 1-4 | With a daemon attached the pane stops taking tab-strip keys; every take ended on `preview` |
| all of the above, again | Re-recorded from scratch once the tmux isolation landed |

`Tab` is overloaded on this screen — it cycles the tab strip AND switches focus
between list and pane — which is why blind Tab counts drift. The tapes now copy
a key prefix proven to land where it says.

## Open, and deliberately not fixed here

| Item | Why it is left | What closing it needs |
|---|---|---|
| `chat_cancel_turns_blocking`'s version check is vacuous — it re-reads `fleet/snapshot` immediately before the write, which removes the staleness property optimistic concurrency exists for | Closing it means a new field on `FleetMessageDelivery` that the daemon populates when it builds the leg. That is a wire change on the message path at the end of the epic, and the exposure is now bounded to one turn deadline rather than the life of the pane | Carry the version the leg was CREATED at from the send through `ChatIntent::CancelTurn`, and pass that as `expected_version` instead of re-reading it |
| The retry sweep is Claude-hook-only: a wire session's ERROR event type is the raw method (`turn/failed`, `thread/error`), none of which is in the allowlist, so Codex and ACP sessions always land in `skipped_opaque` | It fails CLOSED, which is the right direction for a gate that types at an unattended agent. Widening what auto-`continue` reaches is a deliberate behaviour change and needs its own verification, not a longer list | A predicate mirroring the state machine that set ERROR, landed with tests that prove which sessions newly qualify |
| A tmux answer has no timeout of its own, so a wedged tmux server leaves a permanently `InFlight` entry that is un-evictable and refuses re-answering that question until the TUI restarts | Narrow, and it is the one state the per-request design cannot leave. The daemon route is bounded at 5s and the broker route by its own read timeout | A deadline on the tmux send, or an operator-visible way to clear a stuck entry |
| A create with no `provider` racing a swap can read the pre-swap adapter and then be refused `ScopeHeld` | Self-clearing: the next page open succeeds, and the window is the swap itself | Resolving the adapter and minting under one transaction |

Open because the config's `protect_rule` says so in as many words: "Own

The recording it refers to is `docs/assets/screenshots/attention-surface.gif`,
driven by `scripts/attention-surface-demo.sh` through
`docs/assets/screenshots/attention-surface.tape`. FIVE takes were made and four
were discarded rather than published, per the contract:

| Take | Discarded because |
|---|---|
| 1 | The seeded onboarding version was a hardcoded `0.0.0`, so the TUI ran its setup wizard and the tape drove that instead of the sessions screen |
| 2 | Two Tabs from `preview` lands on `thread`, so the answer was typed into the thread composer rather than the ask pane |
| 3 | `Down` never moved the session: `thread` and `copilot` own composers that swallow the arrows |
| 4 | The walk moved ONE row, which is the other session on the same worktree — the same question, so correctly the same outcome, but not the point being shown |

Take 5 is the published one: the ask pane answers, the send refuses as an
ambiguous target with the operator's text kept, the other question's pane
reports nothing, and the failure is still there on return.
