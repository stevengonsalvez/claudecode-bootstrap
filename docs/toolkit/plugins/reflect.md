title: "reflect"
description: "Claude Code plugin for agent self-improvement: captures corrections as learnings, indexes them, and auto-recalls the relevant ones into every new session."
---

`reflect` is a **Claude Code plugin**: it is loaded by Claude Code (Anthropic's plugin system: skills + hooks + commands), not by the ainb TUI. It captures the corrections and design decisions you make in a session as structured learnings, indexes them into a hybrid GraphRAG + BM25 knowledge base, and auto-injects the most relevant prior learnings into every new session. Philosophy: *correct once, never again; recall everything next time.* Current version: **5.2.5** (the ref pinned in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`).

## How it works

![reflect: how it works](../../assets/diagrams/reflect.svg)

The plugin manifest registers five lifecycle hooks. **`SessionStart`** runs two commands: `session_start_recall.py` builds a query from the session's cwd, branch, and recent commits and injects the top-3 reranked learnings as `additionalContext`; and `reflect-drain-bg.sh` launches a detached background drainer that processes any reflections queued from prior sessions. **`UserPromptSubmit`** re-runs recall using the actual prompt as a sharper query (with per-session dedupe), and also completes the mini-learning capture: if a tool just failed and the prompt looks like a correction, it writes a low-confidence learning straight to disk without spending an LLM call.

**`PostToolUse`** is the first half of that cheap capture path: when a tool call fails, it arms a watcher so the next `UserPromptSubmit` can detect a correction. **`Stop`** enqueues short sessions (that ended before compaction) for asynchronous reflection, and **`PreCompact`** enqueues long sessions when Claude Code compacts the conversation: both feed the same `~/.reflect/pending_reflections.jsonl` queue, deduped by `session_id`.

Capture and indexing run through the sub-skills. `/reflect` scans a conversation, classifies corrections vs. successes, and writes a Markdown learning note plus a YAML entity sidecar (people, files, libraries, decisions). The background drainer replays queued transcripts through the same `/reflect` skill headlessly. Everything is dual-indexed into **reflect-kb**: nano-graphrag for semantic + entity-graph search and qmd for fast BM25 lexical search: both running locally.

Retrieval closes the loop: `/reflect:recall` (the same engine the SessionStart and UserPromptSubmit hooks call automatically) runs hybrid search, reranks by confidence × recency × tag overlap, and surfaces the strongest learnings back into the agent's context before the first token is generated.

## What it provides

### Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `reflect` | Full conversation scan: detect behavioral corrections and knowledge signals, classify them, write a learning note with an entity sidecar for GraphRAG indexing |
| `reflect:recall` | Retrieve relevant prior learnings from the global KB via hybrid vector + graph search, reranked by confidence, recency, and tag overlap (also runs automatically at SessionStart / UserPromptSubmit) |
| `reflect:ingest` | The global knowledge indexer: harvest ALL memory sources across tools (Claude, Codex, Copilot, Gemini) into the unified GraphRAG + qmd KB, archiving originals and generating entity sidecars |
| `reflect:consolidate` | Project-level memory consolidation: merge orphaned worktree memory dirs into a single `.agents/MEMORY.md` (deduplicates and sections; does not index into the global KB) |
| `reflect:errors-ack` | Triage and acknowledge entries in the reflect errors sink (`~/.reflect/errors.json`): drain poison, parser crashes, ingest failures, hook timeouts; invoked from the statusline ⚠N badge |
| `reflect-status` | Read-only metrics: pending reviews, sidecar coverage, GraphRAG health; can approve/reject pending low-confidence items |

### Hooks (registered in `plugin.json`)

| Event | What fires |
|-------|-----------|
| `SessionStart` | `session_start_recall.py` injects top-3 learnings from cwd/branch/commits, plus a detached `reflect-drain-bg.sh` that drains the pending-reflections queue in the background |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | `user_prompt_submit_recall.py` re-runs recall against the actual prompt (deduped) and writes a mini-learning if a prior tool failure is being corrected |
| `PostToolUse` | `posttooluse_minilearning.py` arms a mini-learning watcher when a tool call fails (cheap, no LLM call) |
| `Stop` | `stop_reflect.py` enqueues short sessions for asynchronous reflection, deduped against PreCompact |
| `PreCompact` | `precompact_reflect.py --auto --verbose` enqueues the transcript for reflection when Claude Code compacts the conversation |

## Install

Reflect is two layers: the plugin (hooks + skills) and the `reflect-kb` CLI (recall/search + qmd + nano-graphrag). Both now ship from the standalone [stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory) repo (the CLI flattened at the repo root, the plugin under `plugin/`): they are no longer in the agents-in-a-box monorepo, so `claude plugin install reflect@agents-in-a-box` no longer resolves. The one-step path uses `ainb`:

```bash
# 1. CLI engine (recall/search + qmd + nano-graphrag): no subdirectory:
uv tool install --upgrade 'git+https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory.git[graph]'

# 2. plugin: skills + hooks: install NATIVELY per harness from the new repo's
#    plugin/ dir (distinct manifests, no conflict). Install per your harness's
#    plugin runtime / the adapters under plugin/adapters/ (see the repo README).

# 3. everything else in one shot: `ainb reflect bootstrap` auto-installs the
#    reflect-kb[graph] engine via uv (from the new repo URL above) and prints
#    any missing system tools (bash>=4, coreutils, jq) for you to run
ainb reflect bootstrap

# 4. verify: dependency check classified by what needs each tool
ainb doctor
```

`ainb reflect bootstrap` is **hybrid**: it auto-installs the reflect-owned layer (`reflect-kb[graph]`, now from ainb-reflect-memory) and only *prints* the `brew`/`apt` commands for system tools, so it never mutates your OS or PATH. The manual equivalent (with annotated commands + the nano-graphrag `--no-deps` caveat) lives in the [ainb-reflect-memory plugin README](https://github.com/stevengonsalvez/ainb-reflect-memory/blob/main/plugin/README.md#install).

### One plugin dir, three native installs

All three harnesses have native plugin runtimes, and the new repo's `plugin/` dir is a valid plugin for each: the manifests live at distinct paths and reference distinct hooks files, so they coexist without conflict:

| Harness | Manifest | Hooks file | Hook shape | Install |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | inline in manifest | PascalCase, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | from the ainb-reflect-memory `plugin/` dir |
| GitHub Copilot | `plugin.json` (root) | `copilot-hooks.json` | camelCase + `version:1`, `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` | `copilot plugin install` installs skills; hooks via adapter until Copilot plugin hook support ships |
| OpenAI Codex | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | `codex-hooks.json` | PascalCase, `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` | from the ainb-reflect-memory `plugin/` dir |

(All paths above are relative to the new repo's `plugin/` directory.) Shared (read-only) across all three: `skills/`, `hooks/` scripts, `scripts/`. No default-discovery hooks file (`hooks.json` / `hooks/hooks.json`) exists, so no harness auto-loads the wrong-format file.

Hook status per harness:
- **Claude Code**: hooks registered via `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`: fully auto-wired when the plugin is installed.
- **GitHub Copilot**: `plugin.json` `hooks` field is scaffolded for future use; Copilot's plugin system currently installs skills only (hooks listed as "coming soon" in the `github/copilot-plugins` marketplace). Hooks are wired via the Python adapter (`adapters/copilot/copilot_adapter.py install`), which writes `~/.copilot/hooks/reflect.json` with the correct `version:1` camelCase format. Once Copilot ships hook support, the `copilot-hooks.json` and `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` will be used automatically.
- **OpenAI Codex**: hooks registered via `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`: auto-wired on install.

Copilot does not auto-inject `sessionStart` `additionalContext` into the model context in headless `-p` mode, so on Copilot recall is surfaced via manual `/recall`.

## Using it

- **Mostly automatic.** Once installed, the SessionStart hook fires `recall` at the start of every new session and surfaces relevant prior learnings before you type. UserPromptSubmit sharpens that with the actual prompt on each turn.
- **Capture happens for free.** Failed tool calls + correction-shaped follow-ups become low-cost mini-learnings, and short / compacted sessions are queued and drained in the background: no manual step required.
- **`/reflect`**: run it explicitly to scan the current conversation and write a learning note when you want to capture something deliberately.
- **`/reflect:recall "<anything>"`**: query the knowledge base on demand.
- **`/reflect:ingest`**: periodically bulk-index existing memories from any tool into the global KB.
- **`/reflect:consolidate`**: merge scattered worktree memory dirs into one project `.agents/MEMORY.md`.
- **`/reflect-status`**: view pipeline metrics, pending reviews, and KB health; approve/reject low-confidence items.
- **`/reflect:errors-ack`**: triage the errors sink when the statusline shows a ⚠N badge.

## Memory browser

The knowledge base this plugin captures into and recalls from can also be browsed, searched, and
curated from a local web app: `reflect serve`, part of the `reflect-kb` engine. It reads the same
markdown KB the plugin writes to, so archiving or editing confidence there is visible on the next
recall (after a `reflect reindex`). See the
[memory browser guide](/knowledge/reflect-memory/serve) for how to run it.
