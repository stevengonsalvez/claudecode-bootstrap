# Commit

You are tasked with creating git commits for the changes made during this session.

## Initial Response

When invoked, respond with:
```
I'll help you create git commits for the changes in this session.

Let me review what was accomplished and prepare appropriate commits.
```

## Process

### Step 1: Pre-Commit Cleanup

Before creating any commits, ALWAYS perform cleanup:

1. **Check for files that should NOT be committed**:
   ```bash
   # Look for env files that might not be ignored
   ls -la .env* env.* *.env
   
   # Check if they're in .gitignore
   cat .gitignore | grep -E "\.env|env\."
   ```
   
   If any `.env` files are not in `.gitignore`, add them:
   ```bash
   echo ".env*" >> .gitignore
   echo "*.env" >> .gitignore
   ```

2. **Remove debug/test files created during development**:
   ```bash
   # Look for common debug/test files
   ls -la test_*.* debug_*.* tmp_*.* temp_*.*
   ```
   
   Remove any files that were created just to assist development:
   ```bash
   rm test_script.js debug_output.txt temp_*.py
   ```

3. **Remove unnecessary documentation**:
   ```bash
   # Check for markdown files created during this session
   git status | grep "\.md"
   ```
   
   Unless explicitly requested by the user, remove:
   - Work tracking documents
   - Temporary notes
   - Auto-generated docs
   
   Keep only:
   - Explicitly requested documentation
   - Essential README updates
   - API documentation if requested

4. **Verify cleanup**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   
   Present to user if cleanup is needed:
   ```
   I found some files that should be cleaned up before committing:
   
   Files to remove:
   - test_oauth.js (debug script)
   - debug_notes.md (work tracking)
   - .env.local (should be in .gitignore)
   
   Shall I clean these up before creating commits?
   ```

### Step 2: Understand What Changed

1. **Review the conversation history**:
   - Understand what was accomplished in this session
   - Identify the purpose and context of changes
   - Note any bug fixes, features, or refactoring done

2. **Check git status** (after cleanup):
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   - See all modified, added, and deleted files
   - Identify untracked files that need to be added

3. **Review the actual changes**:
   ```bash
   git diff
   git diff --staged
   ```
   - Understand the specific modifications
   - Group related changes together
   - Identify if changes should be one commit or multiple

### Step 3: Plan Your Commits

1. **Determine commit strategy**:
   - Single commit for related changes
   - Multiple commits for distinct features/fixes
   - Atomic commits that each serve a single purpose

2. **Group files logically**:
   - Feature files together
   - Test files with their implementation
   - Configuration changes separately if significant

3. **Draft commit messages**:
   - Use imperative mood ("Add", "Fix", "Update", not "Added", "Fixed")
   - First line: concise summary (50 chars or less ideally)
   - Blank line, then detailed explanation if needed
   - Focus on WHY the change was made, not just what

### Step 4: Present Your Plan

Show the user your commit plan:

```
Based on the changes, I plan to create [N] commit(s):

**Commit 1**: [Type]: [Summary]
Files:
- path/to/file1.js
- path/to/file2.js

Message:
```
feat: add OAuth2 authentication support

- Implement OAuth2 flow with refresh tokens
- Add token storage and validation
- Include error handling for auth failures
```

**Commit 2**: [Type]: [Summary]
Files:
- tests/auth.test.js

Message:
```
test: add comprehensive OAuth2 tests

- Test token refresh flow
- Verify error handling
- Add integration tests for providers
```

Shall I proceed with these commits?
```

### Step 5: Execute Upon Confirmation

1. **Stage files for each commit**:
   ```bash
   # For each commit, add specific files
   git add path/to/file1.js path/to/file2.js
   
   # NEVER use git add -A or git add .
   # Always be specific about what you're committing
   ```

2. **Create the commit**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add OAuth2 authentication support

   - Implement OAuth2 flow with refresh tokens
   - Add token storage and validation
   - Include error handling for auth failures"
   ```

3. **Verify the commits**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -n 3
   ```
   Show the user the created commits

## Commit Message Format

Follow conventional commits format:

### Types:
- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, semicolons, etc)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **build**: Build system or dependencies
- **ci**: CI/CD changes
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Structure:
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Examples:

```bash
# Simple feature
git commit -m "feat: add user profile page"

# Bug fix with detail
git commit -m "fix: resolve race condition in payment processing

The payment webhook could process twice if requests arrived
simultaneously. Added mutex locking to ensure single processing."

# Breaking change
git commit -m "feat!: update API response format

BREAKING CHANGE: API now returns data in 'result' field instead
of root level. Clients need to update response parsing."
```

## Important Rules

### ðŸš« Cleanup Rules (MUST DO BEFORE COMMITS)
1. **ALL `.env.*` files MUST be in `.gitignore`**
   - Never commit environment files
   - Add patterns to .gitignore if missing

2. **REMOVE all debug/test scripts created to assist agent**
   - Delete temporary test files
   - Remove debug output files
   - Clean up any helper scripts

3. **NO documentation unless explicitly requested**
   - Delete work tracking documents
   - Remove temporary markdown notes
   - Only keep docs the user specifically asked for

### Commit Rules
1. **NEVER add co-author information or Claude attribution**:
   - No "Generated with Claude" messages
   - No "Co-Authored-By" lines
   - Commits should be authored solely by the user

2. **Write commits as if the user wrote them**:
   - Use the project's commit style if evident
   - Match the tone of existing commits
   - Be professional and concise

3. **Be selective with staging**:
   - Only commit files that are ready
   - Don't include debug code or temporary files
   - Ensure no sensitive information is committed

## Handling Complex Scenarios

### Multiple Features in One Session

If multiple unrelated features were implemented:
```
I notice we worked on several distinct features. I'll create separate commits for:

1. OAuth implementation (5 files)
2. User profile updates (3 files)  
3. Bug fix for payment processing (2 files)

This keeps the git history clean and makes reverting easier if needed.
```

### Large Changes

For extensive changes, consider:
```
This is a large change. I recommend breaking it into logical commits:

1. Core implementation
2. Tests
3. Documentation
4. Configuration changes

This makes code review easier and helps track what changed where.
```

### Work in Progress

If implementation is incomplete:
```
The implementation isn't complete yet. Would you like me to:

1. Commit completed parts with a clear message
2. Create a WIP commit to save progress
3. Wait until the feature is complete

What's your preference?
```

## Verification Steps

After committing, always:

1. **Show the commit log**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

2. **Verify nothing was missed**:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. **Check the commit contents** (if requested):
   ```bash
   git show HEAD
   ```

## Push to Remote

### When to Push

After creating commits, automatically push to remote with these rules:

1. **Automatic push for feature branches**:
   - Push immediately after commits on non-protected branches
   - Inform user what was pushed after completion

2. **Ask permission ONLY for main/master**:
   ```
   You have commits ready to push to main/master branch.
   This is a protected branch. Please confirm:
   - Have all tests passed?
   - Is the code reviewed?
   - Are you ready to deploy?

   Proceed with push to main/master? (yes/no)
   ```

3. **Always check remote status first**:
   ```bash
   # Check if branch exists on remote
   git branch -r | grep origin/[current-branch]

   # Check if local is ahead/behind
   git status -sb

   # Fetch latest without merging
   git fetch origin
   ```

### Push Process

#### Step 1: Verify Branch and Remote

```bash
# Check current branch
BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)

# Determine if it's a protected branch
if [[ "$BRANCH" == "main" ]] || [[ "$BRANCH" == "master" ]]; then
    # Requires user confirmation (see rules above)
    PROTECTED=true
else
    # Will push automatically
    PROTECTED=false
fi

# Check tracking branch
git branch -vv

# See commits that will be pushed
git log origin/$BRANCH..HEAD --oneline
```

#### Step 2: Inform User What Will Be Pushed

```bash
# Show the commits that will be pushed
echo "Pushing the following commits to origin/$BRANCH:"
git log origin/$BRANCH..HEAD --oneline

# Example output:
# "Pushing the following commits to origin/feature/oauth:
# abc1234 feat: add OAuth2 authentication
# def5678 test: add auth tests
# ghi9012 fix: handle token refresh"
```

#### Step 3: Handle Different Scenarios

**New Branch (not on remote):**
```bash
echo "Creating new remote branch and pushing..."
git push -u origin $BRANCH
echo "âœ“ Successfully pushed $BRANCH to origin"
```

**Existing Branch (already tracking):**
```bash
echo "Pushing to origin/$BRANCH..."
git push
echo "âœ“ Successfully pushed updates to origin/$BRANCH"
```

**Behind Remote (need to pull first):**
```bash
# Fetch and check
git fetch origin

# Always use rebase when pulling to keep history clean
echo "Branch is behind remote. Syncing with rebase..."
git pull --rebase
echo "Retrying push after rebase..."
git push
echo "âœ“ Successfully pushed after rebasing on remote changes"
```

#### Step 4: Verify and Report Success

```bash
# Confirm push completed
git log origin/$BRANCH..HEAD --oneline

# Report success to user
echo "âœ“ Push complete. Your branch is up to date with 'origin/$BRANCH'"

# For feature branches, suggest next steps
if [[ "$PROTECTED" == "false" ]]; then
    echo ""
    echo "Next steps:"
    echo "- Create a pull request: gh pr create"
    echo "- View on GitHub: gh repo view --web"
fi
```

### Push Rules

1. **Automatic push for feature branches**:
   ```bash
   # For non-protected branches, push automatically after commits
   # Just inform the user what was pushed:
   "Pushing 3 commits to origin/feature/oauth-impl..."
   "âœ“ Successfully pushed to origin/feature/oauth-impl"
   ```

2. **Ask permission ONLY for protected branches**:
   ```bash
   # Protected branches require confirmation
   if [[ "$BRANCH" == "main" ]] || [[ "$BRANCH" == "master" ]] || [[ "$BRANCH" == release/* ]]; then
       echo "Ready to push to $BRANCH (protected branch)"
       echo "Please confirm push to protected branch (yes/no):"
       # Wait for user confirmation
   else
       # All other branches push automatically
       echo "Pushing to origin/$BRANCH..."
       git push
   fi
   ```

3. **NEVER force push without explicit permission**:
   ```bash
   # If force push is needed, always ask regardless of branch:
   "This requires a force push which will overwrite remote history.
   This can affect other developers. Are you sure you want to proceed?"
   ```

4. **Always show what will be pushed**:
   ```bash
   # Before pushing, show commits
   echo "Pushing the following commits to origin/$BRANCH:"
   git log origin/$BRANCH..HEAD --oneline
   ```

5. **Handle push rejections gracefully**:
   ```bash
   # If push is rejected, automatically handle it
   echo "Push rejected. Syncing with remote using rebase..."
   git fetch origin
   git pull --rebase

   # Retry push after rebase
   echo "Retrying push after rebase..."
   git push

   # If still fails, it's likely branch protection
   if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
       echo "Push still rejected. This is likely due to:"
       echo "- Branch protection rules"
       echo "- Insufficient permissions"
       echo ""
       echo "Creating a pull request instead..."
       gh pr create
   fi
   ```

### Common Push Scenarios

**Feature Branch Workflow:**
```bash
# After commits on feature branch, automatically push
echo "Pushing feature branch to origin..."
git push -u origin feature/oauth-implementation
echo "âœ“ Successfully pushed to origin/feature/oauth-implementation"
echo ""
echo "Pull request can be created with: gh pr create"
```

**Hotfix Push:**
```bash
# For urgent fixes, push immediately
echo "Pushing hotfix to origin..."
git push origin hotfix/critical-security-fix
echo "âœ“ Hotfix pushed successfully"
echo ""
echo "Creating urgent PR for review..."
gh pr create --title "HOTFIX: Critical security fix" --label "urgent,hotfix"
```

**Release Branch:**
```bash
# Release branches are treated like protected branches
echo "Ready to push to release branch"
echo "Please confirm the following are complete:"
echo "âœ“ All tests pass"
echo "âœ“ Version numbers updated"
echo "âœ“ Changelog updated"
echo ""
echo "Proceed with push to release branch? (yes/no)"
# Only release and main/master branches ask for confirmation
```

## Best Practices

1. **Atomic commits**: Each commit should work independently
2. **Clear messages**: Future developers should understand why
3. **Group related changes**: But don't mix unrelated changes
4. **Test before committing**: Ensure code works
5. **Review diff carefully**: Check for debug code, comments, secrets
6. **Always rebase when syncing**: Use `git pull --rebase` to keep history clean
7. **Automatic push for feature branches**: No confirmation needed, just inform user
8. **Respect branch protection**: Only ask confirmation for main/master/release branches

## Quick Reference

```bash
# See what changed
git status
git diff

# Stage specific files
git add src/feature.js tests/feature.test.js

# Commit with message
git commit -m "feat: implement new feature"

# View recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Amend last commit (if needed)
git commit --amend

# Unstage files (if needed)
git reset HEAD file.js
```

Remember: You have the full context of what was done in this session. Use that knowledge to create meaningful, well-organized commits that tell the story of what was accomplished.
