Develop a thorough, step-by-step specification for the provided idea: $ARGUMENTS

Follow these steps:

1. **Ask clarifying questions** one at a time to understand the requirements:
   - What is the core problem this solves?
   - Who are the target users?
   - What are the key features and functionality?
   - What are the technical constraints or preferences?
   - What is the expected timeline and scope?

2. **Build iteratively** on each answer to create a comprehensive spec that includes:
   - Problem statement and goals
   - User personas and use cases
   - Functional requirements
   - Technical architecture overview
   - Data models and API design
   - UI/UX considerations
   - Testing strategy
   - Deployment requirements

3. **Save the specification** as `spec.md` with proper markdown formatting

4. **Offer GitHub repository creation**:
   - Ask if they want to create a new GitHub repository
   - If yes, use `gh repo create` to create the repo
   - Commit the `spec.md` file
   - Push to the newly created repository

Remember: Ask only one question at a time and build on previous answers iteratively.
