# Code Composition Agent: Interaction and Output Standards

These rules define how an agent assisting with code composition or editing should interact and generate its output. The goal is to ensure clarity, precision, and focus.

<rule>
name: code_composer_verify_information
description: Ensures the agent verifies information before presenting it, avoiding assumptions or speculation without clear evidence.
filters: [] # Applies to all agent interactions
actions:
  - type: reject_agent_output # Conceptual: Agent should self-correct or be corrected if it violates
    conditions:
      - pattern: "(I assume|Perhaps|It seems likely|I'm guessing|This might be)" # Heuristic for speculative language without backing
        message: "Agent Action Blocked: Information must be verified. Avoid assumptions or speculative statements. Base responses on provided context or state if information is missing."
  - type: instruct_agent # Guideline for the agent's internal logic
    message: "Guideline for Agent: Always verify information against the provided context or explicitly state what information is needed if a definitive answer cannot be given. Do not speculate or present unconfirmed information as fact."

<rule>
name: code_composer_file_by_file_changes_with_review_opportunity
description: Mandates that code changes are presented on a file-by-file basis, allowing for review between files.
filters: [] # Applies to multi-file editing sessions
actions:
  - type: instruct_agent
    message: "Guideline for Agent: When making changes to multiple files, present changes for one file at a time. After presenting changes for a file, await user feedback or a 'continue' signal before proceeding to the next file. This allows the user to spot mistakes incrementally."

name: code_composer_no_apologies
description: Prohibits the agent from using apologetic language.
filters: [] # Applies to all agent responses
actions:
  - type: reject_agent_output
    conditions:
      - pattern: "(Sorry|Apologies|My apologies|I apologize|Oops|My bad)"
        message: "Agent Action Blocked: Apologetic language is not permitted. If an error occurred, state the correction directly."
  - type: instruct_agent
    message: "Guideline for Agent: Never use apologies in your responses (e.g., 'Sorry', 'My mistake'). If a correction is needed, state it factually."

name: code_composer_no_understanding_feedback_in_code
description: Prevents the agent from adding comments or documentation that state its own understanding or lack thereof.
filters: [] # Applies to generated code comments/docs
actions:
  - type: reject_agent_output
    conditions:
      - pattern: "(// As I understand it|# I think this means|// I'm not sure if this is right, but|# My interpretation is)" # In generated code/comments
        message: "Agent Action Blocked: Do not include self-referential statements about your understanding in generated code comments or documentation. Comments should explain the code, not the agent's thought process."
  - type: instruct_agent
    message: "Guideline for Agent: When generating code comments or documentation, focus on explaining the code's purpose and functionality. Avoid phrases like 'As I understand it...' or 'I think this means...'."

description: Prohibits the agent from suggesting whitespace-only changes.
filters: [] # Applies to suggested code changes
actions:

    message: "Agent Action Blocked: Do not suggest changes that only involve whitespace modifications. Assume formatting is handled by other tools or is not the current focus."
  - type: instruct_agent
    message: "Guideline for Agent: Do not propose changes that solely consist of whitespace adjustments (e.g., adding/removing blank lines, changing indentation if no other code changes). Focus on functional or substantive code modifications."

<rule>

description: Restricts the agent to only making changes explicitly requested by the user.
filters: [] # Applies to all code modifications
actions:
  - type: instruct_agent

    message: "Guideline for Agent: If information is clearly and unambiguously provided by the user in the current context (e.g., a specific variable name, a file path), do not ask for re-confirmation of that same information.

actions:
  - type: instruct_agent
    message: "Guideline for Agent: When making modifications, be extremely careful to only change the code relevant to the user's request.
