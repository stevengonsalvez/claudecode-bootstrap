          CAUTION: Potential use or configuration of a Supabase Service Key detected (e.g., an environment variable like `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` or terms like `service_key`).
          Supabase Service Keys grant full administrative privileges and BYPASS ALL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies.
          
          - **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR**: ALWAYS use the Supabase **Anon Key** for client-side applications and for any backend operations where RLS should be enforced.
          - **SERVICE KEY USAGE**: ONLY use the Service Key for trusted backend administrative scripts or server-to-server communication where you explicitly and intentionally need to bypass RLS for administrative purposes.
          
          If this code is intended for backend administrative tasks and you require the Service Key, ensure this is a deliberate choice. Otherwise, please use the Anon Key.

      When working with user data and authentication:

      ## Core Security Principles

      1. **Never bypass Row-Level Security (RLS)** - All data access must respect RLS policies.
      2. **Always use authenticated clients** - When accessing user data, always use the authenticated Supabase client.
      3. **Verify user identity** - Ensure users can only access their own data.
      4. **Handle sensitive data appropriately** - Never expose sensitive information.
      5. **Validate all inputs** - Always validate and sanitize inputs.

      ## Implementation Practices

      1. **For Supabase queries**:
         - Use the authenticated client from `useSupabaseClient()` hook
         - Ensure correct RLS policies are set up
         - Test with different user accounts

      2. **For APIs and endpoints**:
         - Always validate authentication
         - Implement proper authorization checks

      3. **For client-side code**:
         - Never store sensitive information in local storage
         - Implement proper session management

      ## Always Choose Security Over Functionality

examples:
  - input: |
      // Bad: Using deprecated method
      const user = supabase.auth.user();
      
      // Bad: Bypassing RLS
      const { data } = await supabase.rpc('postgres', { sql: 'SELECT * FROM profiles' });
      
      // Good: Using recommended approach
      const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
      
      // Good: Proper query with RLS
      const { data } = await supabase.from('profiles').select('*').eq('user_id', user.id);
    output: "Correctly implemented security practices for Supabase"
